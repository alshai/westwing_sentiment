p297
sg9
VLEO
p298
sa(dp299
g7
VIt's important to understand, Leo, that by and large, these aren't fishing boats. You hear fishing boats, you conjure an image of -- well, of a boat, first of all. What the Cubans are on would charitably be described as rafts. Okay? They're making the hop from Havana to Miami in fruit baskets, basically. Let's just be clear on that.

VYou don't think we're taking this seriously? 24 hours ago, the President ordered me to fire Josh Lyman. I've been trying to talk him down from it ever since. He's getting off the plane in ten minutes. It's 6 to 5 at pickin' whether Josh still has a job. Now, I don't know how much more seriously we can take it.

sa(dp1634
g7
VWell, that's just great, why don't we get started. [walks around the table] My name is Sam Seaborn and I'm the Deputy Communications Director. What does that mean exactly? Well, to begin with, I'm a counselor to the President, mostly on domestic matters, though generally not security related. I work with Toby Ziegler, the Communications Director; and C.J. Cregg, the Press Secretary, on crafting our message and getting it out through the electronic and print media. And while my functions here are generally perceived to be politically skewed, it's important to remember that it is not the D.N.C., but rather your tax dollars that pay my salary. So I work for you whether you voted for us or not.

VSure. [pause] The White House, as you know, was built several years ago. Mostly, if I'm not mistaken, out of cement. The room we're in right now, the Roosevelt Room, is very famous. It is named for our 18th President, Franklin Delano Roosevelt. The chairs that you're sitting on today were fashioned from the lumber of a pirate ship captured during the Spanish-American--

VMALLORY
p1708
sa(dp1709
g7
VMs. O'Brian, I understand your feelings, but please believe me when I tell you that I'm a nice guy having a bad day. I just found out the Times is publishing a poll that says a considerable portion of Americans feel that the White House has lost energy and focus. A perception that's not likely to be altered by the video footage of the President riding his bicycle into a tree. As we speak, the Coast Guard are fishing Cubans out of the Atlantic Ocean while the Governor of Florida wants to blockade the Port of Miami. A good friend of mine's about to get fired for going on television and making sense, and it turns out I accidentally slept with a prostitute last night. Now. Would you please, in the name of compassion, tell me which one of those kids is my boss's daughter.

VAh, Toby, if I may interrupt for just a momentae the goals and spirit of Christian and Family oriented organizations, while embraced by a great and growing number of Americans, have been met with hostility and contempt by their Government.

VAnd I'm honored by that, Reverend. First, let me say that when I spoke on the program yesterday, I was not speaking for the President or this administration. That's important to know. Second, please allow me to apologize. My remarks were glib  and insulting.

V[speaks while reading the note] There was this time that Annie came to me with this press clipping. Seems these theologians down in South America were very excited because this little girl from Chile had sliced open a tomato, and the inside flesh of this tomato had actually formed a perfect Rosary. The theologians commented that they thought this was a very impressive girl. Annie commented that she thought it was a very impressive tomato. I don't know what made me think of that. [reporting the information from the slip of paper] Naval Intelligence reports approximately 1200 Cubans left Havana this morning. Approximately 700 turned back due to severe weather, some 350 are missing and presumed dead, 137 have been taken into custody in Miami and are seeking asylum. [pause] With the clothes on their backs, they came through a storm. And the ones that didn't die want a better life. And they want it here. Talk about impressive. My point is this: Break's over.

p2591

VC.J.? Uh, a short while ago the Vice President commented on the White House's position on the A3-C3 saying, and I'm quoting from notes, 'This is the time when the President needs our support.' Can you clarify the language?
p2780
sg9
VMIKE
p2781
sa(dp2782

VNo. I can't, Mike. I haven't spoken with the Vice President today.

V[glances at Toby, then back at Mike] Strange?

VStrained. 'This is the time when the President needs our support.'
p2792
sg9
VMIKE
p2793
sa(dp2794
g7
VIt sounds pretty straightforward. I'll tell you what though, if you consult the morning releases, you'll see that in the world of sports, the White House just got dissed by 12 guys named Flippy.
p2795

sa(dp2797
g7
VWho's got questions?
p2798
sg9
VC.J.
p2799
sa(dp2800

V[on T.V.] I have to say that it came as a bit of a surprise to discover that professional golfers don't have a sense of humor, especially after seeing them in some of the outfits.

V[starts walking with Sam] C.J. just discovered that Hoynes, when responding to a question on A3, said 'this is the time when the President needs our support.' Third one in five weeks.
p2819

p2828

p2831
sg9

VI had a meeting this morning with the Joint Chiefs. [beat] I'm an accomplished man, Morris. I can sit comfortably with prime ministers and Presidents, even the pope. Why is it every time I sit with the Joint Chiefs, I feel like I'm back at my father's dinner table.

VYou guys got into a lot of tough scrapes, did you?
p3305
sg9
VMORRIS
p3306
sa(dp3307
g7
VDidn't have to. We'd just stand on the border and stare you down. Then we'd all go for pancakes. Like you had a lot of closed infantry combat training in premed, huh?
p3308

VBARTLET
p3309

VHold still.
p3341
sg9
VMORRIS
p3342
sa(dp3343
g7
VThank you. I'm not comfortable with violence. [beat] I know this country has enemies, but I don't feel violent toward any of them. I don't know whether that's a weakness or not, but I think I know how the Joint Chiefs would answer that question.
p3344
sg9
VBARTLET
p3345
sa(dp3346
g7
VLet the chiefs get to know you, Mr. President. They're serious men, naturally suspicious of your leadership. That's what comes from spending a lifetime caught between the devil and the deep blue sea. They're men of character. They
p3347
sg9
VMORRIS
p3348
sa(dp3349
g7
VAnd the red meat.
p3350

p3359
sg9
VMORRIS
p3360
