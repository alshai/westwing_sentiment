VYou don't think we're taking this seriously? 24 hours ago, the President\u000aordered\u000ame to fire Josh Lyman. I've been trying to talk him down from it ever\u000asince. He's\u000agetting off the plane in ten minutes. It's 6 to 5 at pickin' whether Josh still\u000ahas a job. Now, I don't know how much more seriously we can take it.

Well, to begin with, I'm a counselor to the President, mostly\u000aon domestic\u000amatters, though generally not security related. I work with Toby Ziegler, the\u000aCommunications Director; and C.J. Cregg, the Press Secretary, on crafting our\u000amessage and getting it out through the electronic and print media. And while my\u000afunctions here are generally perceived to be politically skewed, it's\u000aimportant to\u000aremember that it is not the D.N.C., but rather your tax dollars that pay\u000amy salary.\u000aSo I work for you whether you voted for us or not.

VMs. O'Brian, I understand your feelings, but please believe me when I tell\u000ayou that\u000aI'm a nice guy having a bad day. I just found out the Times is publishing\u000aa poll\u000athat says a considerable portion of Americans feel that the White House\u000ahas lost\u000aenergy and focus. A perception that's not likely to be altered by the\u000avideo footage\u000aof the President riding his bicycle into a tree. As we speak, the Coast\u000aGuard are\u000afishing Cubans out of the Atlantic Ocean while the Governor of Florida wants to\u000ablockade the Port of Miami. A good friend of mine's about to get fired for\u000agoing on\u000atelevision and making sense, and it turns out I accidentally slept with\u000aa prostitute\u000alast night. Now. Would you please, in the name of compassion, tell me which\u000aone of\u000athose kids is my boss's daughter.

g3
VI had a meeting this morning with the Joint Chiefs. [beat] I'm an\u000aaccomplished\u000aman, Morris. I can sit comfortably with prime ministers and Presidents, even\u000athe pope. Why is it every time I sit with the Joint Chiefs, I feel like I'm\u000aback at my father's dinner table.
p3285
sg5
VBARTLET
p3286
sa(dp3287

VI'm a naval officer, sir...
p3288

VMORRIS
p3289
sa(dp3290

VYou're a naval officer. You're a doctor in a uniform. [beat] It's not like\u000aI'm\u000atotally without experience, you know.
p3291
sg5
VBARTLET
p3292

g3
VYes, sir.
p3294
sg5
VMORRIS

g3
VYou guys got into a lot of tough scrapes, did you?
p3300
sg5
VMORRIS
p3301
sa(dp3302
g3
VDidn't have to. We'd just stand on the border and stare you down. Then we'd\u000aall\u000ago for pancakes. Like you had a lot of closed infantry combat training in\u000apremed, huh?
p3303
sg5
VBARTLET
p3304
sa(dp3305
g3
VHold still just a second.
p3306
sg5
VMORRIS
p3307

g3
VWhat is that?
p3309
sg5
VBARTLET
p3310

g3
VSir?
p3324
sg5

VIn the event of a military coup, sir, what makes you think the Secret Service\u000ais gonna be on your side?
p3330
sg5
VMORRIS
p3331
sa(dp3332
g3
VNow that's a thought that's gonna fester.
p3333
sg5
VBARTLET

g3
VHold still.
p3336
sg5
VMORRIS
p3337
sa(dp3338
g3
VThank you. I'm not comfortable with violence. [beat] I know this country has\u000aenemies, but I don't feel violent toward any of them. I don't know whether\u000athat's a weakness or not, but I think I know how the Joint Chiefs would\u000aanswer\u000athat question.
p3339
sg5
VBARTLET
p3340
sa(dp3341
g3
VLet the chiefs get to know you, Mr. President. They're serious men, naturally\u000asuspicious of your leadership. That's what comes from spending a lifetime\u000acaught between the devil and the deep blue sea. They're men of character. They
p3342
sg5
VMORRIS
p3343
sa(dp3344

p3354
sg5
VMORRIS
p3355
sa(dp3356
g3
VYou didn't do nothing, mister. You were a passenger on this one. Your job\u000ais to\u000apay the bills, and do what these ladies tell you to do.
p3357
sg5
VBARTLET
p3358

g3
VYes, sir.

g3
VWhat?
p4425
sg5
VSAM
p4426

VYou and any kid with a decent paper route.
p4443
sg5
VSAM
p4444
sa(dp4445
g3
VAnd you understand that I wasn't abused as a child, that I like what I do?
p4446
sg5
VLAURIE
p4447
sa(dp4448
g3
VReally?
p4449
sg5
VSAM
p4450

VThat it's putting me through law school?
p4452
sg5
VLAURIE
p4453
sa(dp4454
g3
VI wouldn't knock yourself out in torts because there's no state law in this\u000acountry that's gonna admit you with a solicitation bust on your record.
p4455
sg5
VSAM
p4456
sa(dp4457
g3
VI don't plan on getting busted.
p4458
sg5
VLAURIE
p4459

sg5
VLAURIE
p4471

VAnd I'm not just saying that because I want my coat back.
p4473
sg5
VSAM
p4474
sa(dp4475
g3
VYou're gonna try and change me, arguing, asserting a position every time I\u000aturn\u000aaround...
p4476
sg5
VLAURIE
p4477
sa(dp4478
g3
VI'm a lawyer and a speechwriter. I argue for a living, and I'm sought after\u000abecause I'm good at it.
p4479
sg5
VSAM
p4480

VSo what are we supposed to do?
p4518

VLAURIE
p4519

p4542
sg5
VLAURIE
p4543

VTo be honest with you, I don't think I know any state secrets.
