p909
sg8
VHOYNES
p910
sg10
g11
sa(dp911

p912
sg8
VLEO
p913
sg10
g11
sa(dp914
g6
VLeo, the ethanol tax credit has accomplished exactly none of its goals. Production is close to nothing. It will never be large enough to reduce our dependence on foreign oil. And it requires substantial energy to produce, which totally washes out any overall conservation effect.

It hasn't made it through the Senate yet, but that day will come, that day will come, that day will come soon.

You went out to Iowa and said the same things you'd been saying in the Senate for eight years, event though you knew it wasn't going to play. My confession is, you and I agree on ethanol, but you were the only one to say it. You stood in there even though you knew you were going to lose Iowa and who knows what after that. Anyway, I just wanted to say you had a good day today, John.
