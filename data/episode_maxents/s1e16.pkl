I want Zoey to be comfortable with her protection, I don't want her to try and give you the slip. It's not your job to tell me she wants to cut English Lit, it's not your job to tell me if she's dying her hair blue, or going to a strip club, or whatever it is she's doing with her friends.

p908
sg12

VI spent 8 years in the Senate voting against this exact tax credit. I was right, by the way, and I'm still right, but the point is...
p910

g13
sg10
VHOYNES
p911
sg12
g9

V16,000 new jobs. 4 billion dollars invested in plants and equipment, because the tax credit made it economical.

sg10
VLEO
p914
sg12
g9
sa(dp915

VLeo, the ethanol tax credit has accomplished exactly none of its goals. Production is close to nothing. It will never be large enough to reduce our dependence on foreign oil. And it requires substantial energy to produce, which totally washes out any overall conservation effect.

VA truckload of voters, Mr. President, about 47%. Overwhelmingly white men, pool and patio types. Who voted against you by 20 plus points? [suddenly moves over to Bartlet's table.] They share an affinity towards authority, a President. And they see you as smart and having vision, so why didn't they vote for you? Because they also see you as a wimp. Two-thirds of them on a thermometer place you as some degree of weak.

VLook, I get that this is not the most popular idea in the room. But I got numbers, and I know numbers, and I trust numbers. And the reason you're all looking a little pale right now is so do you. This is not theoretical. The flag burning amendment made it through the House with 20 votes over the required two-thirds. It hasn't made it through the Senate yet, but that day will come, that day will come, that day will come soon. Laws against flag burning are favored overwhelmingly in the polls, and a constitutional amendment won't be subject to a Presidential veto, or overturning by the Supreme Court.

VI want to tell you, a couple of years ago in Iowa, I really admired the way you hung in there on the ethanol tax credit. You went out to Iowa and said the same things you'd been saying in the Senate for eight years, event though you knew it wasn't going to play. My confession is, you and I agree on ethanol, but you were the only one to say it. You stood in there even though you knew you were going to lose Iowa and who knows what after that. Anyway, I just wanted to say you had a good day today, John.
