A videotape of a meeting the shooters attended with the leader railing against interracial couples, specifically citing Charlie and Zoey, using the term "lone wolf" over and over, which is the phrase they use when they want their younger members to take matters into their own hands. A copy of Hunter, by William Pierce, bought at a Klan rally in Blacksburg. In the book, Pierce encourages fellow supremacists to rid the earth of interracial couples by shooting them. This is enough -- more than enough -- to begin deposing witnesses.

sg10
VBARRIE
p1442
sg12
g9
sa(dp1443
g6
VNo sir. Again, with all respect, I hate to disagree, but it means unfit for service based on the Pentagon's "two war" doctrine. It's based on how fast these divisions would be able to extract themselves from their peacekeeping mission, retrain on home bases, and ship off to a second of two, full-scale Gulf-War-sized conflicts. There are also some both inside and outside the Pentagon who question whether the C4 ratings might not be a political maneuver on the part of the DOD to help Republican allies in Congress secure more defense money.
