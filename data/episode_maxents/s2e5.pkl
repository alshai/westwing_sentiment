A copy of Hunter, by William Pierce, bought at a Klan rally in Blacksburg. In the book, Pierce encourages fellow supremacists to rid the earth of interracial couples by shooting them.

p1434

VBARRIE
p1435
sg10
g11
sa(dp1436

VTwo divisions, the 10th Mountain Division at Ft. Drum and the 1st Infantry in Germany, have been rated C4. That's the lowest of four possible readiness grades. It means, "Unfit for service."
p1440
sg8
VBARRIE
p1441
sg10
g11
sa(dp1442
g6
VNo sir. Again, with all respect, I hate to disagree, but it means unfit for service based on the Pentagon's "two war" doctrine. It's based on how fast these divisions would be able to extract themselves from their peacekeeping mission, retrain on home bases, and ship off to a second of two, full-scale Gulf-War-sized conflicts. There are also some both inside and outside the Pentagon who question whether the C4 ratings might not be a political maneuver on the part of the DOD to help Republican allies in Congress secure more defense money.
