VNo, actually, what I mean to say is Larry Posner's movies are indicative of a Hollywood that is excessibly violent, arrogantly violent, and is promoting violence and the disrespect to human life.

VBecause Sam is right. It's not that Larry Posner's movies have gratuitous sex and gratuitous violence. It's that they suck. They're terrible. But people go to see them because they have gratuitous sex and gratuitous violence. Now, if we could just get people to stop going to see crappy movies, Posner would stop making them. I promise you.

VWe are going to go out there and implore these people to step up to the plate and not be quite so casual with the awesome influence that they have. That's fantastic. But, sir, every time someone makes headlines by blowing thunder at this ridiculous target, it only serves as a criminal distraction in the pursuit of actual solutions. Now, let me just say one other thing. If I were an actor, a writer, or a director, or a producer in Hollywood and someone would start coming at me with a list of things that were American and un-American, I'd start to think that this was sounding eerily familiar.

VWe were up all night on that one, Toby. Me and Leo and Josh. They were screaming at me, 'Governor, for God's sakes, it's got to be Toby. It's got to be Toby.' When I held my ground, and we went to David Rosen, and Rosen said he wanted to take a partnership at Solomon Brothers, thank God... I couldn't live without you Toby. I mean it. I'd be in the tall grass. I'd be in the weeds... I know I disappoint you sometimes. I mean I can sense your disappointment. And I only get mad because I know you're right a lot of the times, but you are not the kid in the class with his hand up and whatever it was you said to C.J. You are a wise and brilliant man, Toby... The other night when we were playing basketball, did you mean what you said? My demons were shouting down the better angels in my brain?

VI serve at the pleasure of the President, and it's a great privilege that I will never forget. [takes out the card from his wallet, a card that has bothered him for the whole day. He shows it to Leo and the President.] I can't keep this. I think it's a white flag of surrender. I want to be a comfort to my friends in tragedy. And I want to be able to celebrate with them in triumph. And for all the times in between, I just want to be able to look them in the eye. Leo, it's not for me. I want to be with my friends, my family, and these women.
