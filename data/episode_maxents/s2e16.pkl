p492
sg8
VSTEPHANIE
p493
sg10
g11
sa(dp494
g6
VI had the worst feeling you were going to ask. Andrew Jackson, while he was President, had in the main foyer of the White House - I can't believe I'm giving this speech - a two-ton block of cheese. In that spirit, Leo McGarry designates one day for certain senior staff members to take appointments with people or groups that wouldn't ordinarily be able to get the ear of the White House.

p535
sg10
g11
sa(dp536

VOkay, listen. When we're in with Sam, mention what you've just said before, that from everything you've heard, he's the man. He'll want to impress you and show you that he's got access to the President.
