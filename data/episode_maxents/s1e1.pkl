And while my functions here are generally perceived to be politically skewed, it's important to remember that it is not the D.N.C., but rather your tax dollars that pay my salary.

It is named for our 18th President, Franklin Delano Roosevelt. The chairs that you're sitting on today were fashioned from the lumber of a pirate ship captured during the Spanish-American--

VMs. O'Brian, I understand your feelings, but please believe me when I tell you that I'm a nice guy having a bad day. I just found out the Times is publishing a poll that says a considerable portion of Americans feel that the White House has lost energy and focus. A perception that's not likely to be altered by the video footage of the President riding his bicycle into a tree. As we speak, the Coast Guard are fishing Cubans out of the Atlantic Ocean while the Governor of Florida wants to blockade the Port of Miami. A good friend of mine's about to get fired for going on television and making sense, and it turns out I accidentally slept with a prostitute last night. Now.
