VGood morning, Mr. Secretary, ladies and gentlemen and welcome to the final Cabinet meeting of Bartlet one. I don't know if this is true, but a Presidential historian told me that this was the most stable cabinet since Hoover's. Which is nice, but you got to think, how many other jobs were really available? But here are facts. You created over nine million new jobs, and the highest home-ownership rate on record. More than 150 new trade agreements. You created the largest expansion of college aid since the GI Bill. Cleaned up over 500 toxic waste dumps. And you did it all while eliminating 16,000 pages of federal regulations. Not bad for government work. Thank you.

g11

VNo. I'll finish with a little housekeeping for those who don't know. In a two-term Presidency, as a matter of courtesy, the President's cabinet resigns without being asked, giving the President the option of hiring them or not, rather than firing them or not. Those resignations will be submitted today. That's all. Thanks.

p829
sg10

VI don't think you can reasonably ask someone to control who they fall in love with.

VCHARLIE
p844
sg10
g11
sa(dp845
g6
V[to Leo] You wanted to see me.
p846
sg8
VTOBY
p847
sg10
g11
sa(dp848
g6
VI did. Because I read a set of brief remarks for the Better Housing Conferences.
p849
sg8
VLEO
p850
sg10
g11
sa(dp851
g6
VIs that something you usually read?
p852
sg8
VTOBY
p853
sg10
g11
sa(dp854
g6
VNo.
p855
sg8
VLEO
p856
sg10
g11
sa(dp857
g6
VWhy were you reading it?
p858
sg8
VTOBY
p859
sg10
g33
sa(dp860
g6
VBecause it's not something I usually read. I noticed that the writing has a quality that you don't usually find in remarks of this nature. Usually it's written by one of the guys in the shop.
p861
sg8
VLEO
p862
sg10
g11
sa(dp863
g6
VWe're a little shorthanded over there. I did it myself.
p864
sg8
VTOBY
p865
sg10
g76
sa(dp866
g6
VWell, instead of FHA insured home loans, you wrote FEMA insured home loans.
p867
sg8
VLEO
p868
sg10
g11
sa(dp869
g6
VI meant FHA.
p870
sg8
VTOBY
p871
sg10
g11
sa(dp872
g6
VYeah, 'cause FEMA doesn't insure home loans. They don't insure anything. They're the people who come in after a tornado.
p873
sg8
VLEO
p874
sg10
g11
sa(dp875
g6
VI know that.
p876
sg8
VTOBY
p877
sg10
g11
sa(dp878
g6
VWhat do you want to do with Sam gone for three months?
p879
sg8
VLEO
p880
sg10
g11
sa(dp881
g6
VWe talked about this.
p882
sg8
VTOBY
p883
sg10
g11
sa(dp884
g6
VAs long as you still know what you're doing.
p885
sg8
VLEO
p886
sg10
g11
sa(dp887
g6
VThe adjustment period with me, for a new person...
p888
sg8
VTOBY
p889
sg10
g11
sa(dp890
g6
VYou adjusted to Sam.
p891
sg8
VLEO
p892
sg10
g11
sa(dp893
g6
VMaybe, and if I did, it was like, a week ago.
p894
sg8
VTOBY
p895
sg10
g11
sa(dp896
g6
VStill, you could try to...
p897
sg8
VLEO
p898
sg10
g11
sa(dp899
g6
VWho? Who would you get?
p900
sg8
VTOBY
p901
sg10
g11
sa(dp902
g6
VThere are people out there.
p903
sg8
VLEO
p904
sg10
g11
sa(dp905
g6
VThere are not people who... You're like the guys who say, "Are you telling me you could only find one African-American speechwriter good enough to work at the White House?" I'm amazed I found that many. "Good enough to work at the White House" is a pretty small population to begin with. And guys who can write entire sections of a State of the Union? I'd be as surprised if there were as many as nine of us. Sam was one of them.
p906
sg8
VTOBY
p907
sg10
g11
sa(dp908
g6
VOkay. What do you think about Vickie Hilton?
p909
sg8
VLEO
p910
sg10
g11
sa(dp911
g6
VI think we invested time and money teaching her how to fly a warplane which turns out she does very well and there aren't that many who do. So I'm going to go ahead and pick national security over caring who she sleeps with.
p912
sg8
VTOBY
p913
sg10
g11
sa(dp914
g6
VJosh talked to me today.
p915

VLEO
p916
sg10
g11

VIt can't go in the Oval Office.
p918

p919
sg10

g6
VNo, it can't.
p921
sg8

p922

VIt can't.
p924
sg8
VTOBY
p925
sg10

sg8
VLEO
p928
sg10

p930
sg8
VTOBY
p931
sg10
g11
sa(dp932
g6
VNo, Toby, I meant a woman's issue. The constiteuncy of women.
p933
sg8
VLEO
p934

sa(dp935
g6
VYeah.
p936
sg8

p937

p940
sg10

VThis is what I'm saying.
p942

VI wouldn't worry about it, Mr. President.
p957

VC.J.
p958

VI'm not worried about it, but I just read about it.

sg8
VBARTLET
p961
sg10
g11
sa(dp962
g6
VThe news magazines aren't here every day and the empty seats don't look good on camera, so I moved them to the fourth row. I think you shouldn't comment on it.
p963
sg8
VC.J.
p964
sg10
g11
sa(dp965

VI'll comment on it. I'll say sit your ass where you're told and get back to work.
p966

p1080
sg8
VJOSH
p1081
sg10
g11
sa(dp1082
g6
VYeah, she was standing outside when I went to vote. She wanted to trade with a Ritchie voter 'cause she filled out her ballot wrong. I thought it was... kind of cool.
p1083
sg8
VJACK
p1084
sg10
g11
sa(dp1085
g6
VWell, if you like that, she nearly got arrested once when she got her arm stuck in a mailbox trying to retrieve a letter she wrote to Ilie Nastase. She once left her underpants at an art opening and, after a summit in Belarus, she tried to smuggle 11 scented Minsk candles into an overnnight bag. They evecuated the terminal.

p1161
sg8
VDONNA
p1162
sg10
g11

VI thought it went with the vote swapping theme.
p1164

sg10
g11

VIf you know me, if you know me well, if you already like me, these are not stories for instance, I would have told you when I was trying to get the job.
p1179
sg8
VDONNA
p1180
sg10
g11
sa(dp1181
g6
VWhen you were trying to get the job, you were pretending that you'd already gotten the job, so it's not like your underwear at an art gallery was going to change my mind.

VThis is incredibly good, Will. "Never shrinking from the world's..." "...a fierce belief in what we can achieve together." I used to write like this. It was ten months ago. I don't understand what's going on. I really don't. I've had slumps before. Everybody does, but this is different. I'm sorry, we don't know each other, but there aren't that many people I can talk to about it. I don't understand what's happening. There's no blood going to it. I never had to locate it before. I don't even know where to look. I'm the President's voice and I don't want it to sound like this. And there's an incredible history to second inaugurals. "Fear itself," Lincoln... I really thought I was on my way to being one of those guys. I thought I was close. Now I'm just writing for my life and you can't serve the President that way. But if I didn't write... I can't serve him at all.

VYeah. Can I tell you three things? You are more in need of a night in Atlantic City, than any man I've ever met. Number two is, the last thing you need to worry about is no blood going there. You've got blood going there, about thirteen ways. And some of it isn't good. Once again, I say, "Atlantic City." I'd say sit down at a table, go for dinner, see a show, take a walk on the boardwalk and smell the salt air... but if you're anything like me, nothing after "sit down at a table" is going to happen.
