VC.J., last night the energy secretary gave a speech at the Natural Resource Defense Council about the perils of drilling on the North Slope. During a Q&A he was asked about tapping into the Strategic Petroleum Reserve to help ease oil prices. He responded that the idea had a lot of merit. Does this signal a shift in policy since last June?

The President, on a visit to the gallery, and possessing even less taste in fine art than you have in accessories, announced that he liked the painting. The French government offered it as a gift to the White House. [Both stop walking.] I suppose in retribution for EuroDisney. So here it hangs, like a gym sock on a shower rod.

p1503
sg8
VJOSH
p1504
sg10
g11

p1561
sg10
g11
sa(dp1562

VWe can't just take him aside! If we tell him we need his help then we give him visibility and power, and we put him in a position to say 'no' and be a hero to his party! Who wouldn't want to do that for a living?

VThis guy's walking down a street, when he falls in a hole. The walls are so steep. He can't get out. A doctor passes by, and the guy shouts up "Hey you! Can you help me out?" The doctor writes him a prescription, throws it down the hole and moves on. Then a priest comes along and the guy shouts up "Father, I'm down in this hole, can you help me out?" The priest writes out a prayer, throws it down in the hole and moves on. Then a friend walks by. "Hey Joe, it's me, can you help me out?" And the friend jumps in the hole! Our guy says "Are you stupid? Now we're both down here!" and the friend says, "Yeah, but I've been down here before, and I know the way out."
