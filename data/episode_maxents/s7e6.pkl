VGood morning. I'm Will Bailey, assistant to the President and new Director of Communications. I'll be conducting the daily briefings from now on and I have a statement to make at this time. One week from today the President will launch a bold and far-reaching new markets initiative  an inter-agency effort to bring jobs and private investment to distressed urban communities. We're handing out a list of initial agency efforts  small business loans, tax incentives, Commerce's new Adopt and Entrepreneur Program, which, of course, we expect to be controversial. I'll take your questions.

VGood afternoon. We're handing out lists of private sector commitments to the President's new markets initiative. It shows the business community is deeply engaged in job creation for poor communities. As the Eskimo said, "If you store your food in someone else's stomach... um, well, you'd better hope it doesn't need refrigeration."

VIf this becomes a press story, that I'm courting not just the center but the organized left, I'd be kissing off a quarter of the Republican base. I can't win without my own party.
