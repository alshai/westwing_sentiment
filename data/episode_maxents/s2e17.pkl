VAnd that was it. Grissom gave him a rest and an opportunity to answer some real questions about autism, and when Grissom was done, McNamara took over, and after McNamara came Gianelli, grandfathers all. I'm going to have to finish this up now and go into the press room and explain what happened. There'll be no vote tonight and the Senate will go home...
