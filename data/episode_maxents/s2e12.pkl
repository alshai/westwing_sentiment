sg8
VSAM
p544
sg10
g11
sa(dp545
g6
VThere are a number of problems, anyone of which I could have told you about, had you gotten me on the phone! Well, one thing, we already blew off the AFL CIO, cause we told them the President was gonna be in South America.
p546
sg8
VTOBY
p547

p564
sg8
VTOBY

VI'm sayin', I wasn't in there twisting his arm! I told him this opportunity has opened up, that we had enough notes so that I could finish the speech in time. He asked us a few questions, we answered them and he said yes!

We believe his humor can be disconcerting to some but those who are making noise right now are feigning their concern in an effort to frighten white men."
