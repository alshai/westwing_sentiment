VThat's right, and Thursday night we're going to talk about energy dependence versus independence and cleaner burning fuels that get up to 80 miles per gallon versus oil-based fuels that pump billions of pounds of pollution into our air and perhaps just as important our vulnerable to very volatile price spikes.

VWell, for one thing, while the Governor is the presumptive Republican nominee, it's presumptive. For that matter, so is the President's renomination. But more important than that, the President has been a candidate in seven statewide and national elections and every one of them has been a substantive, issued-based campaign, which is one of several reasons why the voters have elected him each and every time his name has appeared on a ballot.

p520
sg10
g11
sa(dp521
g6
VI've never asked him, but my guess is the President feels that a person's college transcripts is a reasonable barometer of how a person did in college. [laughter] For the record, the President graduated Summa Cum Laude from the University of Notre Dame with a major in American Studies and a minor in theology. He received a Masters and a Doctorate at the London School of Economics and an honorary Doctorate in Humane Letters from Dartmouth University where he was a tenured professor.

An artist's job... is to captivate you for however long we've asked for your attention. If we stumble into truth, we got lucky, and I don't get to decide what truth is. What you said about South Korea makes sense, you know, uh, people know more then I do. I... I shouldn't be uh... you know... I write poetry, Toby, that's how I enter the world. [beat] I was thinking maybe, you know... I-I don't if you could do this, but... I was thinking if I could get a few minutes alone with the President, so that could tell him what I saw in Banja Luka? [beat] Then it wouldn't have to be a thing, you know, at the dinner... in there I could, uh... I have 64 couplets on the American experience that I think might be appropriate.
