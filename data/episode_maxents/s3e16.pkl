VI've never asked him, but my guess is the President feels that a person's college transcripts is a reasonable barometer of how a person did in college. [laughter] For the record, the President graduated Summa Cum Laude from the University of Notre Dame with a major in American Studies and a minor in theology. He received a Masters and a Doctorate at the London School of Economics and an honorary Doctorate in Humane Letters from Dartmouth University where he was a tenured professor.
