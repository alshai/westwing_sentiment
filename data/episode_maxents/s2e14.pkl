p780

p781
sg10

VI wouldn't make that phone call with a gun to my head.
p783
sg8
VJOSH
p784
sg10
g11
sa(dp785
g6
VI have a gun to my head and I'm not making that phone call. I inherited the war on drugs from a President, who inherited it from a President, who inherited it from a President before that. I'm not a hundred percent sure who we're fighting but I'm sure we're not winning. Ten years ago we spent $5 billion fighting drugs and we did such a good job that last year we spent $16 billion. Sixty percent of Federal prisoners are in jail on drug charges as opposed to two and a half percent in jail for violent crime. We imprison a higher percentage of our citizens than Russia did under Communism and South Africa under Apartheid. Somewhere between fifty and eighty-five percent of our prison population has a drug or alcohol abuse problem. We've tried "just say no." I don't think it's going to work. [looks at his watch] I'm mentioning this because I'd like you to give me any thoughts you might have on the subject.

I'd say, Mr. President... don't do it. You're considering authorizing a massive commitment of troops and throwing in our lot with torturers and panderers. Leaders without principle and soldiers without conviction with no clear mission, and no end in sight. This war is at home. The casualties are in our prisons, and not our hospitals. The amount of money the American government is spending in Columbia is the exact same amount American consumers are spending buying drugs from Columbia.
