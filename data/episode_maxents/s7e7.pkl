VI'm Forrest Sawyer and I will moderate tonight's debate following rules worked out by representatives of the candidates. I've agreed to enforce their rules. Now, each candidate will have a two-minute opening statement. I'll then ask a series of questions, all of them chosen by me alone. I've told no one what the subjects or the questions will be. For each question, there'll be a two-minute answer followed by a one-minute rebuttal with a possibility of a 30-second extension of the discussion at my discretion. A yellow light will come on when there are 15 seconds left in an answer. A flashing red means time's up. And, if we need it, we have a backup buzzer.

VYou know, I've watched every televised Presidential debate that this country has ever had. And every time I heard them recite the rules, I always thought that meant they're not going to have a real debate. When the greatest hero of my party, Abraham Lincoln debated, he didn't need any rules. He wasn't afraid of a real debate. Now I could do a 2-minute version of my Sensible Solution stump speech and I'm sure Congressman Santos has a memorized opening statement ready to go. And then we could go on with this ritual and let the rules decide how much you're going to learn about the next President of the United States, or we could have a debate Lincoln would have been proud of. We could junk the rules. We could let our able and judicious moderator ask us questions. And we could forget about whether each of us has the exact same number of seconds to speak. We could have a real debate if that's all right with you, Matt.

p120

VSAWYER
p121
sg10
g11
sa(dp122
g6
VEnforcement first; that's my policy. I would double the border patrol. Not just increase it; double it. We need to make a statement that says "We mean it this time. We really are cracking down on illegal immigration." And we need that statement to be heard loud and clear on the other side of the border where everyone knows how easy it is to get in to this country. I want everyone on the other side of the border to think about how hard it is to get into this country. That's the kind of Sensible Solution you can expect from the Vinick White House.

VI don't know how you're going to find room in the budget to double the border patrol with the tax cut that you're proposing. Why not double the border patrol? I'll tell you why not: because we already have. Since 1990 we've tripled, not double, tripled the border patrol along the Mexican border and you don't need me to tell you that it hasn't solved the problem.

VDoubling the border patrol means that 80% of illegal entries will get in instead of 90%. Don't let anyone tell you that the border can be secured by doubling the border patrol. The problem of illegal immigration is much bigger than the border patrol.

VYou've all heard it, right? My most famous quote of the campaign: 'I voted for CAFTA before I voted against it.' Sounds ridiculous, doesn't it? I voted for CAFTA in the Ways and Means Committee because it was a good bill. But then special interests went to work on it. Corporate lobbyists started squeezing in special provisions for their clients and suddenly it wasn't a free trade bill anymore. It certainly wasn't a fair trade bill, and so, yes I voted against it.

VTrade agreements are part of the solution and so is my guest worker program. We have to face the fact that we have at least 10 million people who have illegally entered this country but who are now putting in an honest day's work and they're mostly doing jobs that Americans do not want to do.

VThis is not a law enforcement problem. This is an economic problem. If Mexico's economy was as strong as Canada's, there wouldn't be a problem. The President cannot solve this problem. You cannot seal a 2,000-mile border. Mexico has to solve it. Mexico has to grow its own economy. It has to provide enough jobs so that it's not worth it to try to cross into our borders illegally. There is no other real solution to this. And Senator Vinick is smart enough to know that and I think you are, too.

VOh, you've seen this game before. We have a proven record on Republican tax cuts. First, they cut taxes. Then, they never get around to cutting spending so they run up huge deficits and they leave massive debts for our children to pay. If you elect me as President, that is a game that I won't play.
p255

VSANTOS
p256
sg10
g11
sa(dp257

VYou know, Congressman Santos is running a very brave campaign. I have to give him credit for that. He's actually promising a tax increase, which is a brave thing to do because the American people don't want it. And it's the wrong thing to do because the American people don't want it. But even his big tax increases won't be enough to raise money for the big spending increases he's promising. So President Santos would have to do exactly what he's promising not to do: run up huge deficits and leave massive debts for our children and grandchildren to pay.
p258

VIt's a lie that every President, Democrat and Republican, has been telling for 20 years: we're going to be number 1 in ten years. Go ahead, Google it right now. I'm not saying that every President knew it was a lie when he said it or that Congressman Santos knows it's not true, but I do. So let me tell you what our goals should be  our realistic goals. First of all, let's stop pretending that everyone can or should go to college. Every airline needs high-paid mechanics and none of them have to go to college. There are plumbers in some parts of the country that make a better living than dentists. Now, I'm not talking about lowering our ambitions. I'm talking about targeting our ambitions correctly. Now, it's true: some other countries have raised their academic standards over and above what they were once. But we still have the best scientists in the world, the best doctors, and by far the most Nobel prizes. If a kid does well in one of those foreign high schools, guess where he or she wants to go to college. That's right; Harvard, Stanford, Cal-Tech, the University of Texas, and a hundred other American universities that are better than anything they have in their countries. So, if we're going to have a practical approach to education, we're going to have to admit that not every one can go to MIT. But most of the kids who do go to MIT come from American public schools.

The best kept secret in the world  in our country  is that Medicare is the most efficient health care system in the world.

VSome African tax rates are the highest in the world. In Tanzania, the 30% rate kicks in at $475 of income plus this 30% value added that they put onto everything. Those high tax rates have made it impossible build capital in those countries. So, as a result, nothing gets built; not roads, not factories, not anything. Poor African countries have the lowest wage earners in the world, but a company like Nike, for instance, can't put a factory in there because of those oppressive tax rates. Taxes have killed any possibility of economic development. They've killed any hope of those countries helping themselves. And the result is they become completely dependant on charities, on loans. You know... here's the worst part: you know why those tax rates are so high? Because of us. Because they have to prove to us that they can raise enough money to pay back their loans. But taxes can't raise any money if they kill the economy. So, it turns out that the tragic, unattended consequence of our good intentions toward Africa - our kindness  is that we have forced those countries to lock themselves into an economic depression. If we don't urge those countries to lower their tax rates, they will never grow their economies. People will live lifetimes of unemployment. Disease will be rampant. Poverty will be permanent. Children will be hungry. And our charity will never be enough. Never.

VI think we should forget about more gun control. What we need is bullet control. That's right. There are at least 100... 200 million guns in this country. I own three of them We cannot control the supply of guns in this country but we can control the supply of ammunition. Buying bullets should not be easier than buying a plane ticket. We should license the purchase of handgun ammunition. There should be a clear, ID record of every handgun ammo purchase. We're in the 21st Century. Homicide detectives should be able to trace every fired bullet back to the buyer in minutes.

VI've disclosed the every name of the 220,000 people who have contributed to my campaign. There are no secrets about where my campaign money comes from. Some of my contributors work for oil companies. Now Liberals want you to think that's evil. They want you to think you can't be a good American if you work for an oil company. I can remember when people were condemned in this country for what they thought, condemned for their political positions. Liberals fought the noble fight against that witch hunt. Liberals said it was un-American and they were right. Now Liberals want to condemn people because of where they work?

VNow, unless you're prepared to prove, not just accuse but prove with facts that your opponent is influenced by campaign contributions, then let's agree to move on.

p708
sg8
VSAWYER
p709
sg10
g11
sa(dp710

VBecause we cannot drill our way to energy independence. There's only about a year's worth of oil there at best. I don't think that's worth disrupting a million years of ecological balance and a unique and spectacular wilderness.

VUh-huh. And that's about as many people who will ever go to ANWR. None. I mean, maybe a few very rich people will go up there with private planes and snap some pictures in the summertime. I mean, this ain't the Grand Canyon we're talking about. How many of you have been to the Grand Canyon?
p732
sg8
VVINICK
p733
sg10
g11
sa(dp734
g6
VIf they discovered big oil reserves in the Grand Canyon, I'd never let them drill there because it's our most magnificent natural monument and because real people get to go there. They get to see it, they get to taste it, to touch it, to experience it in all its glory. Now, you know, we're talking about a country that has oil wells within site of the beautiful beaches of Santa Barbara; oil wells within site of every Texas beach; thousands of operating oil wells in the city of Los Angeles. I just saw an oil well in the parking lot of a McDonalds in Long Beach the other day. And now Democrats are saying we can't put oil wells in a place so remote that only the animals will see them? I wish we could put all our oil wells up there, where no one could see them.

g11
sa(dp746
g6
VDid you say 'completely safe'? I'm sorry. I don't want to be an alarmist here but there are plenty of obvious safety concerns. That's why we stopped building them. The government should be supporting the development of alternative energy sources and all of those new technologies that can harness solar power, wind power; all of those safer, new alternatives to nuclear power.

p750
sg8
VSAWYER
p751
sg10
g11
sa(dp752
g6
VI don't trust politicians to choose the right new energy sources. I believe in the free market. You know, the government didn't switch us from whale oil to the oil found under the ground. The market did that. And the government didn't make the Prius, the hottest selling car in Hollywood. That was the market that did that. In L.A. now, the coolest thing you can drive is a hybrid. Well, if that's what the free market can do in the most car-crazed culture on Earth, then I trust the free market to solve our energy problems. You know, the market can change the way we think. It can change what we want. Government can't do that. That's why the market has always been a better problem-solver than government and it always will be.

VSAWYER
p823
sg10
g11
sa(dp824
g6
VWell, Senator Vinick was eager to take a pledge about taxes, but now taking a pledge about anything else is beneath the dignity of the Presidency. The President has to lead. He has to actively head off problems, not just hope the market will figure out everything for him. It's the free market that Senator Vinick trusts so much that has left 45 million people without health insurance. But to his credit, the Senator's very honest about the fact that he has no health care plan, no education plan, no jobs plan, no energy plan. All he has is a tax plan. After he cuts taxes, what's he going to do for the next four years?
p825
sg8
VSANTOS
p826
sg10
g11
sa(dp827
g6
VTax cuts are not a magic wand that you can wave at every problem. Senator Vinick is very quick to attack my plans, but the Presidency is about more than just saying no, no, no. You have to say yes to something. You have to do something. We don't have enough time for me to remind you about every policy difference that you've heard here tonight. But when you go to work tomorrow and you're talking about this debate, talk about the qualities that you want to see as a President; the leadership qualities. Ask yourself if Matt Santos is the kind of guy who's going to give up on the promises that he's made tonight because it's going to be too tough to get them done. Talk about what it was like for Matt Santos to go from where he was baptized 45 years ago to where he's standing tonight. Ask yourselves what it was like to do that. And then ask yourselves if you're ready to give Matt Santos the Presidency of the United States. You know, you've seen the stories: in newspapers all over the world, people are asking is America ready for a Latino President. I have never asked that question. I never asked if Annapolis was ready for a Latino midshipman. I never asked if the Marines was ready for a Latino fighter pilot. I didn't have to ask. I just had to prove that I was ready, that I could get the job done. I am asking for your vote now because I know that I am ready to do the job. I thank you.

VSenator Vinick, your closing statement.
p831
sg8
VSAWYER
p832
sg10
g11
sa(dp833
g6
VFirst of all, I want to thank Matt for agreeing to drop the rules tonight and let us have a real debate. And what you've heard, over and above the many policy differences, were different philosophies of government. I believe both of us want what's best for this country, we just have different ideas about how to go about it. I think it's fair to say that Matt has more confidence in government than I do. I have more confidence in freedom  your freedom; your freedom to choose your child's school, your freedom to choose the car or truck that's right for you and your family, your freedom to spend or save your hard-earned money instead of having the government spend it for you. I'm not anti-government. I just don't want any more government than we can afford. I don't want government doing things it doesn't know how to do or doing things the private sector does better or throwing more money at failed programs because that's exactly what makes people lose faith in government. And all of us, Democrats and Republicans, Independents, Liberals or Conservatives, we all want a government that we can believe in. We all want a government that doesn't make false promises, a government that doesn't overreach, doesn't take on more than it can handle; an efficient, effective, honest government. That's what the Founding Fathers created. That's what they wanted for us. The choice in this election comes down to this: do we want more government or do we want to get control of government. To govern is to choose and the choices are never easy. There are lobbies out there that will fight you on every choice you make. They're ready to call you names the second you make a choice they don't like. You heard that heckler go after me tonight. You have to be tough to stand up to that. But being tough won't help you make the right choice. That takes experience and mature judgment. That's what the Presidency needs now more than ever. And that's why I ask you to give me your vote: so that I can give you the government that you were promised by the Founding Fathers. Thank you, very much.
