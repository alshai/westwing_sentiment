VWell, here's my question. These guys look pretty young to me, and I'm looking for something very specific with this detail. This is a father-daughter situation, and so what I think I'm looking for in terms of protection would best be categorized as, well, overwhelming force. Do they have that? Do they have the ability to just overwhelm any danger that might...? Do you have overwh...? Do they have overwhelming force?
