They're not allowed to be in the company of any man other than a close relative, they're required to adhere to a dress code that would make the Maryknoll Nun look like Malibu Barbie. They beheaded 121 people last year for robbery, rape, and drug trafficking, they've no free press, no elected government, no political parties, and the royal family allows the religious police to travel in groups of six, carrying nightsticks and they freely and publicly beat women. But "Brutus is an honorable man." Seventeen schoolgirls were forced to burn alive because they weren't wearing the proper clothing. Am I outraged? No, Steve. No Chris. No, Mark. That is Saudi Arabia, our partners in peace. Bonnie, then Scott.

VIt's funny... [thinks about his choice of words] It's a coincidence that you should happen to mention the time of the meeting. See, President Chigorin only has to fly through one time zone. President Bartlet has to fly through seven. Don't get me wrong, this President can do three shows a night, but there's no one in the Western Hemisphere who has a worse reaction to jetlag than he does. Any trip 8 hours or longer and someone gets fired at the end of it, and it's already been me three times, so...

VAha. Time to teach these Stoli-drinking Tchaikovskys a thing or two about free press American style! You don't ban those who supported you opponent, you make them wallow in their losedom by covering your victory. You sit them in the front row. You give them a hat! I will save Ludmila Koss, for I am Toby, and in doing so... Why am I going on like this?

VCome on, Ron, I haven't had a boyfriend in a... I get a lot of hate mail. After the President, I'm the single most visible person in the Federal government, every day I'm on TV and every day exactly half the people are going to disagree with you and some of those people are going to hate you and some of those are gonna write letters.
p549

sa(dp575

VMulsim extremists don't get personal. They don't know your name, they don't care. They don't want one person, they want dozens or hundreds, that's why they don't use bullets. Killing one person is a waste of a bomb. He wants you, why doesn't he want me? Someone will be along in a few minutes to get your hard drive and we're intercepting all your e-mails from the address.

p622
sg10

This one's 50 megawatts thermal, which is identical to the reactor Pakistan's got in Kushab. This isn't used to make the lights go; it's used to make plutonium. Mr. President, I'm not your National Security Advisor, or your Secretary of Defense or State. But the Russians are giving Iran the bomb.
