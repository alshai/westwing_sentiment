VI say, we know you're one of us. Six Commissioners on the F.E.C. Two just resigned, leaving four, including you. The belief has always been that none of the four of you favor a ban on soft money contributions. But the truth is, you do.

p486
sg8
VBARRY
p487
sg10
g11
sa(dp488
g6
VYes, it is. And the way that I know that it is is cause you said so. You said so to the Newark Star Ledger on March 13, 1995, "Money isn't speech." And you said so two years before that to the Detroit Free Press, "We must reverse the 1978 Regulatory decision allowing soft money."
