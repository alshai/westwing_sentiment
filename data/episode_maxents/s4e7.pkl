VAccording to the last 300 daily dairies, the President is typically 70 to 90 minutes over-scheduled by the end of the day. The median time a day ends, the over/under 10:20 p.m. As many days have ended after that time as have ended before it. The result being the Commander in Chief of the U.S. Armed Forces hasn't had a night's sleep in four years. That's both bad and easy to fix.
