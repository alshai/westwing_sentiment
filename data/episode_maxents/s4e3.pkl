But there's violence in our schools, too much mayhem in our culture and we can do something about that. There's not enough character, discipline, and depth in our classrooms. There aren't enough teachers in our classrooms. [applause] There isn't nearly enough, not nearly enough, not nearly enough money in our classrooms, and we can do something about that.

Toby, college costs-- investment in the future workforce, in innovation, in the ideas economy, investment in crime reduction-- Isn't that a better idea then writing off the bonuses? The guy last night in the bar, Matt Kelley, the one who's taking his daughter to visit colleges. He said it needs to be just a little easier. Not a lot easier, a little.

If a college football team cut back to 70 scholarships, they'd still be three deep in every position and have a fourth string punter and place-kicker. 15 scholarships. That's a wrestling team.

He came downstairs to the bar 'cause he didn't want her to see that he didn't know how he was going to pay for it.
