But there's violence in our schools, too much mayhem in our culture and we can do something about that. There's not enough character, discipline, and depth in our classrooms. There aren't enough teachers in our classrooms. [applause] There isn't nearly enough, not nearly enough, not nearly enough money in our classrooms, and we can do something about that.

Toby, college costs-- investment in the future workforce, in innovation, in the ideas economy, investment in crime reduction-- Isn't that a better idea then writing off the bonuses? The guy last night in the bar, Matt Kelley, the one who's taking his daughter to visit colleges. He said it needs to be just a little easier. Not a lot easier, a little.

V25 years ago, half of all 18 to 24 year-olds voted. Today it's 25%. 18 to 24 year-olds represent 33% of the population but only account for 7% of the voters. Think government isn't about you? How many of you have student loans to pay? How many have credit-card debt? How many want clean air and clean water and civil liberties? How many want jobs? How many want kids? How many want their kids to go to good schools and walk on safe streets? Decisions are made by those who show up! You gotta rock the vote!

VThere are a lot of reasons not to do it. But... we met a guy last night at an airport hotel in the bar. His daughter was upstairs in the room. They'd been looking at colleges. He makes $55,000 a year. His mutual fund got beat up yesterday on Wall Street. And he was so happy to be taking his daughter to colleges. He came downstairs to the bar 'cause he didn't want her to see that he didn't know how he was going to pay for it. There are a lot of reasons not to do it, but during the first campaign the President said there are two kinds of politicians.
