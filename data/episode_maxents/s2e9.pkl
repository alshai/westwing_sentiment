VYeah. Yeah. Galileo Galilei. He sat in a cathedral in Pisa. He watched a lamp suspended from the ceiling as it oscillated back and forth. He used his pulse to keep time and discovered that the period of oscillation was independent of the size of the arc. A few years later he contradicted the theory that a heavier body falls faster than a lighter one. Which took some guts back in 1609, when you consider that the theory he was contradicting was Aristotle's.
