p536
sg12
g32
sa(dp537
g6
VWrong again, and I will refer you to the Surgeon General's comments. When asked if marijuana should be legalized, she said and I'm quoting, "It's not for me to say." And she's right, and it's important that people understand this the Surgeon General's not a law-maker, she doesn't set drug policy, the President does, and the President is 100% against legalizing drugs including marijuana.

Fifteen people in a room with the door closed; seven democrats, seven republicans, and the President of the United States, who will not have a vote, and they walk out of that room, and with one voice they make a recommendation to Congress and the American people! And nobody knows who was where! [sighs] The only way this is going to happen is in secret. And they only way it's going to happen is if all the sides are confident in their representation. Otherwise it's dead, and so I need Seth Gillette on the commission, but I can't ask him, 'cause if he says no, there'll be no commission! [beat] Anyway...
