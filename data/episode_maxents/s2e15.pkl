VYeah, but we can't risk that. First of all, we need him on the Commission, or else labor and seniors will be suspicious from the getgo; second, if he's not going to be on the Commission, it can't be because he turned us down.
p441
sg8
VTOBY

sg10
g11

VI don't agree with your categorization of the comments; I think she expressed her opinion about the health effects of certain illegal drugs.
p531
sg8
VC.J.
p532
sg10
g11
sa(dp533
g6
VWell, she basically called for legalization of marijuana. Does the President agree with it?
p534
sg8
VJOSH
p535
sg10
g11
sa(dp536
g6
VWrong again, and I will refer you to the Surgeon General's comments. When asked if marijuana should be legalized, she said and I'm quoting, "It's not for me to say." And she's right, and it's important that people understand this the Surgeon General's not a law-maker, she doesn't set drug policy, the President does, and the President is 100% against legalizing drugs including marijuana.
p537
sg8
VC.J.
p538

VBecause it's the only way it's gonna happen! Because you can't solve Social Security and ask people to run for election at the same time! So why not give politicians some cloud cover and let them be lawmakers for a while? Fifteen people in a room with the door closed; seven democrats, seven republicans, and the President of the United States, who will not have a vote, and they walk out of that room, and with one voice they make a recommendation to Congress and the American people! And nobody knows who was where! [sighs] The only way this is going to happen is in secret. And they only way it's going to happen is if all the sides are confident in their representation. Otherwise it's dead, and so I need Seth Gillette on the commission, but I can't ask him, 'cause if he says no, there'll be no commission! [beat] Anyway...
