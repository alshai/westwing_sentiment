p486
sg8
VSAM
p487
sg10
g11
sa(dp488
g6
VWell, all that's beings investigated, but I'm assuming that when a ship runs into the shore it has something to do with either the navigation or the steering.

sg8
VBARTLET
p505
sg10
g11
sa(dp506
g6
VWell, I'm going to talk to quite a few of them. But let me ask you this. Is it possible for someone with relapsing/remitting MS to experience an attack that would include temporary loss of proper brain function but exclude any physical symptoms?
p507
sg8
VOLIVER
p508
sg10
g11
sa(dp509
g6
VLet me put it another way. Is it possible you could be sitting in this room, have an attack, and I don't know it?
p510
sg8
VOLIVER
p511
sg10
g11
sa(dp512
g6
VI think what you're asking is, Is it possible I could be sitting in the Situation Room, have an attack, and nobody knows it.
p513
sg8
VBARTLET
p514
sg10
g11
sa(dp515
g6
VYes.
p516
sg8
VOLIVER
p517
sg10
g18
sa(dp518

p519
sg8
VBARTLET
p520
sg10
g11
sa(dp521
g6
VOkay sir, uh... before we go any further, there's something that I want to make sure is absolutely clear.
p522
sg8
VOLIVER
p523
sg10
g11
sa(dp524
g6
VWhat's that?
p525
sg8
VBARTLET

p531
sg8
VBARTLET
p532
sg10
g11
sa(dp533
g6
VHe's a government lawyer. The privilege doesn't exist.
p534
sg8
VLEO
p535
sg10
g11
sa(dp536
g6
VSo you want to be very careful about what you say in this room right now, Mr. President, because if subpoenaed to give a deposition, I'm not going to lie under oath.
p537
sg8
VOLIVER
p538
sg10
g11
sa(dp539
g6
VI don't want to be careful about what I say in this room.
p540
sg8
VBARTLET
p541
sg10
g11
sa(dp542
g6
VWell, then we should end this meeting and you should retain private counsel.
p543
sg8
VOLIVER
p544
sg10
g11
sa(dp545
g6
VI want you. I meant, I don't need to be careful.
p546
sg8
VBARTLET
p547
sg10
g11
sa(dp548
g6
VOkay. I'd like to ask you some questions now. These are preliminary, and with no preparation and in no particular order.
p549
sg8
VOLIVER
p550
sg10
g11
sa(dp551
g6
VYeah.
p552
sg8
VBARTLET
p553

VHave you ever been party to a lawsuit?

VHave I ever been party to a lawsuit?
p558
sg8

sa(dp560
g6
VYes, sir.
p561
sg8
VOLIVER
p562
sg10
g18
sa(dp563
g6
VI was governor of New Hampshire. Anybody who...
p564
sg8
VBARTLET
p565
sg10
g11
sa(dp566
g6
VI mean a lawsuit in which you gave a deposition.
p567
sg8
VOLIVER
p568
sg10
g11
sa(dp569
g6
V(heavy sigh) A meter reader slipped on a patch of black ice in my driveway and I got dragged into some pain-in-the-ass thing over my great-aunt's will.
p570
sg8
VBARTLET
p571
sg10
g11
sa(dp572
g6
VAnd you gave a deposition in both those cases?
p573
sg8
VOLIVER
p574
sg10
g11
sa(dp575
g6
VYeah.
p576
sg8
VBARTLET
p577
sg10
g11
sa(dp578
g6
VDo you recall at any time in those depositions when you were asked about your health?
p579
sg8
VOLIVER
p580
sg10
g11
sa(dp581
g6
VOliver, why are we talking about my great-aunt's will and the meter reader?
p582
sg8
VBARTLET
p583
sg10
g11
sa(dp584
g6
VBecause if you were asked about your health and lied in a deposition, that's the ballgame. We're all going home.
p585
sg8
VOLIVER
p586
sg10
g11
sa(dp587
g6
VHe never lied.
p588
sg8
VLEO
p589
sg10
g11
sa(dp590
g6
VLeo, I'd like to hear the President say that.
p591
sg8
VOLIVER
p592
sg10
g11
sa(dp593
g6
VI never lied.
p594
sg8
VBARTLET
p595
sg10
g11
sa(dp596
g6
VYou never had to testify under oath about your health?
p597
sg8
VOLIVER

sa(dp599
g6
VNo.
p600
sg8
VBARTLET
p601
sg10
g11

g6
VYou never answered any interrogatories or depositions about your health?
p603

sa(dp605
g6
VNo.
p606
sg8
VBARTLET
p607
sg10
g11
sa(dp608
g6
VOkay. The First Lady and your kids, that's four. The six original doctors and radiologists, that's ten; your brother, that's 11. Fitzwallace, the Vice President, and Leo, that's 14...
p609
sg8
VOLIVER
p610
sg10
g11

VAnd the anesthesiologist at GW.
p612

p633

VOLIVER
p634

VThis past Friday night.
p636
sg8
VLEO

p639

VOLIVER

VNot well.
p642
sg8
VLEO
p643
sg10
g11
sa(dp644
g6
V(sighs deeply) I wouldn't think so, Mr. President, I have some more questions. Is there time now?
p645
sg8
VOLIVER
p646
sg10
g11
sa(dp647
g6
VWell, the Mexican economy crashed, an oil tanker busted up about 120 miles from here and 13 percent of Americans are living in poverty. So yeah, I can hang out with you and answer insulting questions for awhile.
p648
sg8
VBARTLET
p649
sg10
g11
sa(dp650
g6
VGood.
p651
sg8
VOLIVER
p652
sg10
g11
sa(dp653

g6
VCarol Villenuevo?
p657
sg8
VMAN
p658
sg10
g11
sa(dp659
g6
VYes. Says she'll have it for us in an hour to review it. That's when the President's going to call you and ask you to fast track it. He wants you to take it straight to mark-up and vote.
p660
sg8
VJOSH
p661
sg10
g11

VJosh, my members are going to need a day to read the thing.
p663

g6
VWe understand, but we don't have a day.
p666
sg8
VJOSH
p667
sg10
g11
sa(dp668

p675
sg8

p676
sg10

p678

VMAN
p679
sg10
g11
sa(dp680

VAll right, you understand we may not have anything ready till 2:00, 3:00 in the morning.
p681
sg8
VMAN
p682
sg10

p684

p685
sg10

g6
VYou also understand no one here has said yes yet.
p687
sg8
VMAN
p688
sg10

sa(dp689
g6
VI noticed that.
p690
sg8
VJOSH
p691
sg10

VAll right. Uh... you mind if we use the room to talk?
p693
sg8
VMAN
p694
sg10

VNot at all. You mind talking fast?
p696

VThe number of people whose permission I need before I can do whatever the hell I want... Let me tell you something. There's really a lot to be said for fascism.

VNo.
p726
sg8

VC.J....
p732
sg8
VJOSH
p733
sg10
g11
sa(dp734
g6
VJosh, when there's a leak, I do what I do. Finding the person is usually impossible under benign circumstances but with Toby blasting around the halls whoever it was has gone so far underground we could start our search in Beijing.
p735
sg8
VC.J.
p736
sg10
g11
sa(dp737
g6
VWhat about asking Cashin?
p738
sg8
VJOSH
p739
sg10
g11

VCashin isn't going to roll over on a source.
p741
sg8
VC.J.
p742
sg10
g11

VThen you've got to get a swinging light bulb in there and just do it.
p744
sg8
VJOSH
p745
sg10
g11
sa(dp746
g6
VYeah, this from the guy who had four kinds of aneurysms when he had to interrogate the staff on drug use.
p747
sg8
VC.J.
p748
sg10
g11
sa(dp749
g6
VThat was a lot different.
p750
sg8
VJOSH
p751
sg10
g11
sa(dp752
g6
V'Cause it was you?
p753
sg8
VC.J.
p754
sg10
g18
sa(dp755
g6
VNo, because that was an investigation into personal behavior. This guy compromised a policy initiative.
p756
sg8
VJOSH
p757
sg10
g11
sa(dp758
g6
VThat's a fair point and I'm not saying it's not bad I'm just saying I'm not going to find him.
p759
sg8
VC.J.
p760
sg10
g11
sa(dp761
g6
VYou're absolutely not going to find him.
p762

VYes.
p768

VHe's a textiles worker in South Carolina making $12.17 an hour with no health insurance. His two kids go to public school. The school's fine, but they've had to cut art and music for budget reasons, and Frank's ten-year-old is just nuts about the trumpet, so the mom does telemarketing at night after the kids have gone to bed to pay for lessons and rent an instrument. Not that art and music are important or that any of us had any fun or met friends doing it. Frank obeys the law and pays his bills. He also pays his taxes, and he called to thank you for sending his money to Mexico.

VBecause... Look, I was very proud of myself for making such a great deal and it really sealed it for me with the partners and they were about to make me one. And it really didn't bother me that the boat was cheap for a reason. But then, at the 11th hour, I had a change of heart. For whatever reason, I had a change of heart and I told them the boat wasn't good enough, particularly with regards to the steering and navigation systems, which, of course, they already knew, and I suggested they spend more money, and they said...

VAinsley, unless a company like this is forced to fork over so much money they don't want to go on living -- unless they're compelled to pay $500 million -- there's no incentive for them to pay the extra 11 million to make the boat safer.

VYeah, I jotted it down. Apparently they're at war, but we've taken a firm stand as an isolationist nation and refused to get involved. Our resources are our own and their problems are on the other side of the world. Though, they do have problems. It sounds to me from what they said on the phone that France, Austria, and England are getting absolutely pounded by the Germans, and with no end in sight. They say that by 1941 they're gonna desperately need our help if they have any chance of survival. But I think they're just being hysterical. This son of a customs agent with the Charlie Chaplin mustache ain't going anywhere. But there's no telling that to Franklin Roosevelt, who's trying to convince his country they need to get involved. That's why he came up with this.
