VHe's a textiles worker in South Carolina making $12.17 an hour with no health insurance. His two kids go to public school. The school's fine, but they've had to cut art and music for budget reasons, and Frank's ten-year-old is just nuts about the trumpet, so the mom does telemarketing at night after the kids have gone to bed to pay for lessons and rent an instrument. Not that art and music are important or that any of us had any fun or met friends doing it. Frank obeys the law and pays his bills. He also pays his taxes, and he called to thank you for sending his money to Mexico.

Our resources are our own and their problems are on the other side of the world. Though, they do have problems. It sounds to me from what they said on the phone that France, Austria, and England are getting absolutely pounded by the Germans, and with no end in sight. They say that by 1941 they're gonna desperately need our help if they have any chance of survival. But I think they're just being hysterical. This son of a customs agent with the Charlie Chaplin mustache ain't going anywhere. But there's no telling that to Franklin Roosevelt, who's trying to convince his country they need to get involved. That's why he came up with this.

VWe won't discuss this any more for the time being. It'll be public soon enough. And the more conversations you have with me, the more lawyers you're gonna have to talk to, and they bill in an hour what you take home in a week, so we won't discuss it except to say this you're gonna be subpoenaed. I'm confident in your loyalty to me. I'm confident in your love for me. If you lie to protect me, if you lie just once, if you lie just a little, if you lie 'cause you can't stand what's happening to me and the people making it happen, if you ever, ever lie...
