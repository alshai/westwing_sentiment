VSTANLEY

VNo, you don't. Nor us anymore, for that matter. One-third of all math teachers and half of science teachers didn't major or minor in that subject.

VSTANLEY
p484
sg10
g11
sa(dp485
g6
VAnd we'll want to get to the bottom of that. But we're increasing education spending to over a $100 billion a year and, as a result, we have seventh grade textbooks being used in ninth grade and the same answers get a higher score on S.A.T.s.

VI got 800/790. For the life of me, I can't imagine what I got wrong. Then I took them again, and got 800/790. I mean, is it possible there was some sort of number-two pencil anomaly that could've...?

VSTANLEY

VSo our schools have reached a crisis and our infant mortality rate is two and a half times what it is in Singapore. So what I think we should do for starters is, we should keep more people alive, then send them to school. Get a little peace and prosperity going.

VStanley, the width and depth of what I haven't done about it yet... You know you can't do anything about hurricanes? The President can't do anything about nature or bad luck. I ought to be able to do something about the airplane.

g11
sa(dp722

VI met a guy there, a Bermudian whose name I'm not going to tell you right now. He was explaining the game to me. He's a cricket nut. He plays in a league. And he's a ramp signal agent at a small airstrip. He marshals planes as they're coming in. He was telling me a story to illustrate how much he loves cricket. There was a day his supervisor told his four-person crew they had tomorrow off 'cause a training crew was coming in to work their shift. Well, the next day, the guy realized that he left his cricket bat in his locker at work and his wife had the car so he walks six-miles back to the airstrip to get it. Except, when he got there, he wasn't allowed in. Three men in coveralls, who identified themselves as being part of the training crew, were standing out front. All three of them were white, two of them had Southern accents. On May 21st, he was told to take tomorrow off. On the 22nd... Abdul Shareef's plane went off radar 85 miles from Bermuda.

VI'm back and I'm happy about it. And I think you know how I feel about you. But don't mess me around on this story, okay? The three guys out front were U.S. Army Rangers. I got to change my clothes.

VI don't think that's the point. I'm not trying to create a plan for a lasting cease-fire. Right now, I'm just trying to fix a roof. Is that really not possible down there? See if you can find a U.N. relief and recovery unit anywhere around there, or an NGO that could serve as neutral-- God-- as a nuetral part to oversee transportation, storage and repair. Thank you.
