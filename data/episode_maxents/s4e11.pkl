VI met a guy there, a Bermudian whose name I'm not going to tell you right now. He was explaining the game to me. He's a cricket nut. He plays in a league. And he's a ramp signal agent at a small airstrip. He marshals planes as they're coming in. He was telling me a story to illustrate how much he loves cricket. There was a day his supervisor told his four-person crew they had tomorrow off 'cause a training crew was coming in to work their shift. Well, the next day, the guy realized that he left his cricket bat in his locker at work and his wife had the car so he walks six-miles back to the airstrip to get it. Except, when he got there, he wasn't allowed in. Three men in coveralls, who identified themselves as being part of the training crew, were standing out front. All three of them were white, two of them had Southern accents. On May 21st, he was told to take tomorrow off. On the 22nd... Abdul Shareef's plane went off radar 85 miles from Bermuda.
