[applause] And I'm sure where Josh is over at the phone banks they'll be confirming that. But, when the numbers are crunched and the polls are taken I think everyone here realizes that the truly important thing is that I changed my hair. [laughter] Seriously, um, this is not my official toast. My official toast is later. I just wanted to say informally before the President got here.
