VMr. McGarry, the Committee thanks you for your appearance today. Why are we here? What are we after? Many, if not most of us, were surprised by the President's announcement that he's been diagnosed with relapsing/remitting multiple sclerosis for seven years and never mentioned it while asking us to vote for him for President but more surprising still, if not stunning is that his medical condition could have been kept a secret from those campaign aides closest to him. In this age when the most minute details of a candidate's life are brought into the light in a business where secrets aren't kept secret very long this Committee would like to know, quite candidly how it was pulled off. Did people lie? Were people told to lie? Are people lying now? You'll be questioned by Majority Counsel then Minority Counsel then each member will have five minutes to question alternating back and forth between the majority and the minority. Mr. Calley.
