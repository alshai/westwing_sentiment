VMr. McGarry, the Committee thanks you for your appearance today. Why are we here? What are we after? Many, if not most of us, were surprised by the President's announcement that he's been diagnosed with relapsing/remitting multiple sclerosis for seven years and never mentioned it while asking us to vote for him for President but more surprising still, if not stunning is that his medical condition could have been kept a secret from those campaign aides closest to him. In this age when the most minute details of a candidate's life are brought into the light in a business where secrets aren't kept secret very long this Committee would like to know, quite candidly how it was pulled off. Did people lie? Were people told to lie? Are people lying now? You'll be questioned by Majority Counsel then Minority Counsel then each member will have five minutes to question alternating back and forth between the majority and the minority. Mr. Calley.

VWhat are you doing here?
p447
sg8
VBARTLET
p448
sg10
g11
sa(dp449

VI don't know. What do you got? You got leaves. I came to look at the leaves.
p450

g6
VWhat are you doing...?
p453
sg8
VBARTLET
p454
sg10
g11
sa(dp455

VI came to talk to you.
p456

VEverything's okay?
p459
sg8

VYeah.
p462

p463

g6
VWhy didn't you call?
p465
sg8
VBARTLET
p466
sg10
g15
sa(dp467
g6
V'Cause you would've asked me what I wanted to talk to you about.
p468
sg8
VLEO
p469
sg10

g6
VWhere are you staying?
p471

VAt the Marriott.

VWhat do you want to talk to me about?
p477
sg8
VBARTLET
p478
sg10
g11
sa(dp479
g6
VI've been thinking about getting back into politics.
p480
sg8
VLEO
p481
sg10
g11
sa(dp482
g6
VI think that's great, man. I think it's about time. You probably mean the House, but I think you should consider the Senate seat in Illinois in two years; I can help raise money.
p483
sg8
VBARTLET
p484
sg10
g11
sa(dp485
g6
VNo, I wasn't thinking about the Senate. I was thinking about the White House.
p486
sg8
VLEO
p487
sg10
g11
sa(dp488
g6
VHey, Leo, I swear to God there's no one I'd rather see in the Oval Office than you but if you run there's going to be a lot of discussion about Valium and Alcohol. I mean, it's going to come out; this is the world.
p489
sg8
VBARTLET
p490
sg10
g11
sa(dp491
g6
VYeah. See, I wasn't thinking about me.
p492
sg8
VLEO

VWho?
p495
sg8
VBARTLET
p496
sg10
g11
sa(dp497
g6
VI've been walking around in a kind of daze for two weeks and everywhere I go...planes, trains, restaurants, meetings...I find myself scribbling something down.
p498
sg8
VLEO
p499
sg10
g11
sa(dp500
g6
VWhat? Leo takes a napkin out of his pocket, licks it, and sticks it on the posterboard easel. It reads "Bartlet for America."
p501
sg8
VBARTLET
p502
sg10
g11

VNo.
p519
sg8
VLEO
p520
sg10
g11
sa(dp521

VWell, then, I'd like to ask you this-If he had told you about his condition would you still have thought it was a good idea that he run?
p522
sg8
VRATHBURN
p523
sg10

VI don't know.
p525

p528
sg8
VRATHBURN
p529
sg10
g11
sa(dp530

VI'm really asking you.
p540
sg8
VJORDAN
p541
sg10
g15
sa(dp542
g6
VI think Rathburn's being a little snotty I think he's going to have to wait and I think he's going to have to wait with the camera on me.
p543
sg8
VLEO
p544
sg10

p546

sa(dp551
g6
VI don't know.
p552
sg8
VJORDAN
p553
sg10

p555
sg8
VLEO
p556
sg10

p558
sg8

p559
sg10

V[to Committee] Congressman, could you repeat the question, please?
p561
sg8
VLEO
p562
sg10
g11
sa(dp563
g6
VIf Jed Bartlet had told you about his health either at the first meeting or the second meeting would you still have thought it was a good idea for him to run?
p564

p639
sg8
VBARTLET
p640
sg10
g11

g6
VSkyler wants you to call up the Guard?
p642
sg8
VGOVERNOR
p643
sg10
g11
sa(dp644
g6
VSkyler wants to know why the hell you haven't.
p645
sg8
VBARTLET
p646
sg10
g11
sa(dp647
g6
VBecause local law enforcement is doing plenty.
p648
sg8
VGOVERNOR
p649
sg10
g11
sa(dp650
g6
VWas Eisenhower wrong in '57? Kennedy in '61?
p651
sg8
VBARTLET
p652
sg10
g11
sa(dp653
g6
VThis is a different situation.
p654
sg8
VGOVERNOR
p655
sg10
g11
sa(dp656
g6
VWe don't know what the situation is, do we, Josh?
p657
sg8
VBARTLET
p658
sg10
g11
sa(dp659
g6
VNo, sir. Mr. President, this is Special Agent Mike Casper who's acting as the FBI's White House liaison during this situation.
p660
sg8
VJOSH
p661
sg10
g11
sa(dp662
g6
VDo we know what's going on, Agent Casper?
p663

p664
sg10
g11
sa(dp665
g6
VNo, sir.
p666
sg8
VMIKE
p667
sg10
g11
sa(dp668
g6
VEdward, so far the churches have been empty. There have been no fatalities. But tomorrow night's Christmas Eve. They're going to be packed. So why shouldn't I send troops in?
p669
sg8
VBARTLET
p670
sg10
g11
sa(dp671
g6
VBecause, due respect, Mr. President but you do it without my consent and it's a clear violation of State's rights and you would have said the same thing when you were the Governor of New Hampshire.
p672
sg8
VGOVERNOR
p673
sg10
g11
sa(dp674
g6
VThis doesn't happen in New Hampshire.
p675
sg8

p676
sg10
g11

VYou got a pretty big black population in New Hampshire, do you?
p678

VSo, what have you got cooking?
p696
sg8
VBARTLET
p697
sg10

g6
VI'm sorry?
p699
sg8

VI said, what have you got cooking?
p702
sg8

p703
sg10

g6
VI don't understand.
p705
sg8
VJOSH
p706
sg10
g11
sa(dp707
g6
VYes, you do. I know what happened at the third debate. He told me. I know what's going to happen this afternoon. What are you going to do? Are you going to try and get Gibson out of the room when it's his turn to question?
p708
sg8
VBARTLET
p709
sg10
g11
sa(dp710
g6
VI don't think you and I should discuss it, sir.
p711

p720

VCHAIRMAN
p721
sg10
g11

p723
sg8
VDEARBORN
p724
sg10
g11
sa(dp725
g6
VAbbey's about to get spanked. Guys, the things we do to women. My wife's a world-class scientist.
p726
sg8
VBARTLET
p727
sg10
g11
sa(dp728
g6
VDo you know who Edith Wilson was?
p729
sg8
VDEARBORN
p730
sg10
g11
sa(dp731
g6
VEdith Wilson was Edith Galt before she became the second wife of Woodrow Wilson.
p732
sg8
VLEO
p733
sg10
g11
sa(dp734
g6
VAnd with the help of her doctors she ran this country for months while her husband was incapacitated by a stroke.
p735
sg8
VDEARBORN
p736
sg10
g11
sa(dp737
g6
VYes.
p738
sg8
VLEO
p739
sg10
g15
sa(dp740
g6
VDo you believe that the President having a stroke falls within the scope of the 25th Amendment?
p741
sg8
VDEARBORN
p742
sg10
g11
sa(dp743
g6
VExcuse me, but with the Wilsons being dead for 80 years I don't believe it falls within the scope of this hearing.
p744
sg8
VJORDAN
p745
sg10
g11
sa(dp746
g6
VAbbey Bartlet knew of her husband's condition.
p747
sg8
VDEARBORN
p748
sg10
g11
sa(dp749
g6
VYes.
p750
sg8
VLEO
p751
sg10
g15
sa(dp752
g6
VAnd she kept it to herself.
p753
sg8
VDEARBORN
p754
sg10
g11
sa(dp755
g6
VWell, I don't know who she kept it to, Congressman.
p756
sg8
VLEO
p757
sg10
g11
sa(dp758

VShe didn't tell you.
p759
sg8
VDEARBORN

sa(dp761
g6
VNo.
p762
sg8
VLEO
p763
sg10
g11
sa(dp764

VOr anyone else in the high command of the Bartlet campaign? You're smiling.
p765
sg8
VDEARBORN
p766
sg10
g11
sa(dp767
g6
VYes, sir.
p768
sg8
VLEO
p769
sg10
g15
sa(dp770
g6
VWhy?
p771
sg8
VDEARBORN
p772
sg10
g11
sa(dp773
g6
VBecause at this point there wasn't much of a high command. All we'd done is show a strong third in Iowa. We were working out of storefront.
p774
sg8
VLEO
p775
sg10
g11
sa(dp776
g6
VYou got to pop the ball. You got to pop it.
p777

VNo, you're not.
p783
sg8
VTOBY
p784
sg10

p786
sg8
VSAM
p787
sg10
g11
sa(dp788
g6
VYeah?
p789
sg8
VTOBY
p790
sg10
g11
sa(dp791
g6
VIs that we're fine playing this song in South Carolina.
p792
sg8
VSAM
p793
sg10
g11
sa(dp794
g6
VI agree.
p795
sg8
VC.J.
p796

g6
VPop it.
p798
sg8
VTOBY
p799
sg10
g11
sa(dp800
g6
VAs long as all he's doing is running against Wiley it's fine that he doesn't seem like a real candidate.
p801
sg8
VSAM
p802
sg10
g11
sa(dp803
g6
VIt's when Wiley drops out and he's running against Hoynes.
p804
sg8
VTOBY
p805
sg10
g11
sa(dp806
g6
VRight. They'll cover us all the way to South Dakota. Suddenly, we don't want to be quaint anymore. People want to know "Is this guy for real?"
p807
sg8
VSAM
p808
sg10
g11
sa(dp809
g6
VWe got to show them we're an honest-to-God alternative. We got to show them we're big time.
p810
sg8
VSAM
p811
sg10
g11
sa(dp812
g6
VCan we get an intern over here?
p813
sg8
VC.J.
p814
sg10
g11
sa(dp815
g6
VWhat about this. A series of major, national policy addresses. We work with Josh; we pick three issues.
p816
sg8
VSAM
p817
sg10
g11
sa(dp818
g6
VYeah, and we should start projecting the image that he thinks he's for real.
p819
sg8
VTOBY
p820
sg10
g11
sa(dp821
g6
VWe'll release his tax returns, put all his stocks in a blind trust.
p822
sg8
VC.J.
p823
sg10
g11
sa(dp824
g6
VYou know what else?
p825
sg8
VSAM
p826

sa(dp827
g6
VYeah.
p828
sg8
VTOBY
p829
sg10
g11
sa(dp830
g6
VHe should take a physical.
p831
sg8
VSAM
p832
sg10
g15
sa(dp833
g6
VAbsolutely. He's got ten years on Hoynes. We should release a medical report.
p834
sg8
VC.J.
p835
sg10
g11
sa(dp836
g6
VI'll take it to Leo.
p837

sa(dp1673

VThat's because you think it has something to do with smart and stupid. Do you have any idea how many alcoholics are in Mensa? You think it's a lack of willpower? That's like thinking somebody with anorexia nervosa has an overdeveloped sense of vanity. My father was an alcoholic. [leans forward] His father was an alcoholic. So, in my case...

VNot while I'm the Majority Counsel, it's not. This is bush league. This is why good people hate us. This right here. This thing. [Bruno turns his back on them and leans on a table.] This isn't what these hearings are about. [Gibson glances over at Bruno, peeved.] He cannot possibly have been properly prepared by counsel for these questions, nor should he ever have to answer them publicly.
