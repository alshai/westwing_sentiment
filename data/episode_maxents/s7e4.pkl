VI understand. But can't we agree that the inclusion of non-scientific explanations into the science curriculum of our schools misrepresents the nature of science? And therefore compromises a central purpose in our public education which is the preparation of a scientifically literate workforce. If you have a problem with your child's education, get involved. If you have a problem with what the School Board wants to teach, run for School Board. We can never forget that the best way to preserve our democracy is to take part in it. Thanks for your question.

Together, with Israeli Prime Minister Zahavy, we pursued the challenge of a brave and just peace. Our goal was a better future for the children. But old enemies die hard and last night hatred and fear took our friend in a senseless act of cowardice. How then should we respond to such violence and despair? I know that Chairman Farad would want us to take a moment to remember those innocent victims who perished with him. They were seven students studying at universities in Jerusalem. And their names are: Salim Saida, age 19, Palestinian; Akiva Eshkol, age 23, Israeli...

VTo be a person of faith is to have the world challenge that faith. Was the universe designed by God? That's up to everyone in this country to decide for themselves because the framers of our Constitution believed that if the people were to be sovereign and belong to different religions at the same time then our official religion would have to be no religion at all. It was a bold experiment then, as it is now. It wasn't meant to make us comfortable. It was meant to make us free.
