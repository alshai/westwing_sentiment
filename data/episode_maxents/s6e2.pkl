VI was born in the city of Safra. Do you know Safra? It's in the mountains of Habrigaly. I was eight years old when the leaders left. There were 52 Arabs in Safra but only a thousand three hundred Jews. Within a month, the Haganah had taken over the city. My eldest sister, Amira, was killed. The body of my brother, Aziz, was found hanging from a burned Cyprus tree. We fled to Syria; lived in tents, ate the United Nations handouts and surplus American cheese. I still remember the view of the valley from the roof of our house; the smell of the pomegranates; the sound of children playing in our orchard. The home of my father, of my aunts and uncles, they are now art galleries and bed and breakfasts. Will I get to go home, Ms. Harper?
