VGood afternoon. Let me give you a brief rundown of what's happened at Camp David this morning. The delegations continue to meet to discuss a number of issues. They will begin at 10:00 and will resume after lunch. They will end early, as it is Friday, and Prime Minister Zahavy has invited the President and First Lady to join the Israeli delegation for a Shabat dinner. I'll take a few questions. Katie?

There were 52 Arabs in Safra but only a thousand three hundred Jews. Within a month, the Haganah had taken over the city. My eldest sister, Amira, was killed. The body of my brother, Aziz, was found hanging from a burned Cyprus tree. We fled to Syria; lived in tents, ate the United Nations handouts and surplus American cheese. I still remember the view of the valley from the roof of our house; the smell of the pomegranates; the sound of children playing in our orchard.
