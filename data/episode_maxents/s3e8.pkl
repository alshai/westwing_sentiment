VI got this from the DoJ, civil addition. Three months ago at a fundraiser the President was asked about airbags. Someone suggested they're more dangerous than benefits.

VGood evening. We have two birthdays today, so we have cake. One cake. It's nice to share. Quickly, before I take questions, a late edition to Monday's schedule, the President will be at the opening of the Smithsonian exhibit commemorating the sixtieth anniversary of the attack on Pearl Harbor. That's three in the afternoon, and I'll have more information Monday morning. Labor Secretary Carl Reed will brief from this podium in one hour's time on our school-to-work initiative, and, let me check, yeah, while that's going on, there'll be a briefing at the Department of Health and Human services by USDA director David Rhinegold. Sometime Tuesday you'll be briefed at the Pentagon. The DOD will be annoucing that we've renewed our lease another ten years with the Khalifa Airbase in Qumar. I understand they've promised to paint and add new carpet.
