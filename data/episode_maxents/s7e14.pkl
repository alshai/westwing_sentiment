VI was the last one out of the holding room tonight. I saw it, I thought it was one of ours. There was no name on it. I opened it up...

p867
sg8
VBRUNO
p868
sg10
g11

VI don't want to know any more about this. I want to be able to say I had nothing to do with this. I didn't know anything about it. [pause] You stole Matt Santos' briefcase?
p870
sg8
VVINICK
p871

VI didn't steal it; I found it.
p873
sg8
VBRUNO
p874
sg10
g11
sa(dp875

p876

VVINICK
p877
sg10

VI didn't think of that.
p879
sg8
VBRUNO
p880
sg10
g11
sa(dp881

VYes, you did. And you would have done it in a second unless you found something in there, something that would hurt Santos.
p882
sg8
VVINICK
p883
sg10

p891

VI need to talk to a lawyer. I need to think this through.
p894
sg8
VVINICK
p895
sg10
g11
sa(dp896
g6
VAs soon as that information comes out - the Santos campaign: it's over. So, you do not have to go to California tomorrow and do that painful press conference which is going to play as if that nuclear accident was somehow your fault. And you do not have to draw any more attention to the fact that your polls aren't looking so good right now. And you can keep campaigning in the South and Midwest - look like you're driving your own train instead of jumping on Santos' train.
p897

p900

VI said don't tell me.

sg8
VVINICK
p907
sg10
g11
sa(dp908
g6
VIt's a day-planner. It has notes about meetings, people, lots of stuff that can be embarrassing - what he really thinks about the Vice President, how bad a campaigner Leo McGarry is. And he also has a checkbook in there. It's a strange one. It just says "M. Santos." It's not a joint account with the wife, there's no address on the checks. He just uses it for ATM withdrawals and one check each month, same amount, made out to someone named Anita Morales. There is an Anita Morales - 29 years old, never married, one child, seven-year old girl - she's a clerk in Houston, hired seven years ago by Mayor Matt Santos. Come on, we've all heard the rumors about Matt Santos.
p909

VThere are rumors about all of us.
p912

VVINICK
p913

p915
sg8
VBRUNO
p916
sg10
g11
sa(dp917
g6
VYou have to give back that briefcase.
p918
sg8
VVINICK
p919
sg10
g11
sa(dp920
g6
VIf this comes out he's going to have to take a DNA test. He's going to have to prove that he did not have an affair, or a child, with a woman he's been making monthly payments to for who knows how long.
p921

p930
sg8
VVINICK
p931
sg10
g11
sa(dp932

VVINICK

VVINICK
p1003
sg10
g11
sa(dp1004

VI'm not blaming anyone. President Bartlet did everything he could within current law to maintain safety at these plants. When I'm President, I'm going to strengthen those safety regulations.
p1005
sg8
VVINICK
p1006
sg10
g11

p1015
sg10
g11
sa(dp1016

VI was very eager to make sure that California had an adequate supply of low-cost electricity. You know the governor and most of the states Congressional Delegation supported the building of the plant.

VVINICK
p1225
sg10
g11
sa(dp1226
g6
VYeah, probably from his jail cell. You know, Santos never got the vetting a front-runner gets. He was never supposed to get the nomination. The press gave him a free ride in the primaries. Until now, he's been running way behind you, so the press still hasn't done their digging on him. But they will now. So, it really doesn't matter what you do with that briefcase. It's going to come out. If it comes out while Santos is in the White House... I don't know what happens. All hell will break loose.

VYou know what, if I agreed with a candidate on the issues, and I was ready to vote for him, and something like this came out about him, I'd still vote for him.
p1236

VVINICK
p1237
sg10
g11
sa(dp1238
g6
VGood. That's you. And that's maybe most Santos voters. And it is every voter in France. But it is not this country, not yet. I don't want people wishing they could change their votes after this comes out. The voters have a right to know about it before making their voting decision.

g11

VDon't tell anyone, but I don respect the voters. That's why I win. I find out what they care about. I don't try to tell them what they care about.

p1248

VVINICK
p1249
sg10
g11
sa(dp1250
g6
VIt's my idea of democracy. The voters get to set the terms of the elections, not us. They get to decide what's important, not us. That's why I think voters have a right to this information now instead of six months from now. They could be electing a President who's drowning in scandal when he's supposed to be trying to stop World War III from starting in Kazakhstan. And that is not the kind of guy most of the country wants to be the next Commander-In-Chief.

VWe're not going to use it. But it's going to come out eventually. The press is going to find out. They're going to find Anita Morales. Camera crews are going to follow her daughter to school.

p1351
sg10
g11
sa(dp1352

VYou think the people who work for you wouldn't have done exactly the same thing if they had found my briefcase? If the press finds out about this next week, then all that happens is you lose an election. But if you win and the press finds out next month or next year then I don't know what happens to you or your Presidency. That's what you have to think about. Right now, you have a responsibility to the voters to...

p1357
sg10
g11

VDo you really think you can handle this if it comes out while you're living in the White House with your family? Do you really want to put the country through that? Put your wife through that?

VMy brother's never been good about living up to his responsibilities. He went out with Anita for a while and then disappeared like he always does. He's never really been able to hold onto a job. When I found out about the baby I figured somebody had to step up.
p1365

p1366
