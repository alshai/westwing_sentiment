There are 162 games in major league baseball season and the players have a saying "Every team's going to win 54 games, every team's going to lose 54, it's what you do with the other 54 games that counts." In your district, you got democrats, you got republicans, and the other 54 games are women. Specifically young mothers, among who the number one issue is crime. You are a graduate of Oberlin and Duke Law School. You passed up many lucrative opportunities to work in the D.A's office. You are a prosecutor with an exceptional conviction record and certainly nobody can hang "soft on crime" around your neck. You're active in local politics. You're personable. You are articulate and energetic. You are married and you're having a baby.

VChapter and verse. I wanted to ask you a couple of questions while I had you here. I'm interested in selling my youngest daughter into slavery as sanctioned in Exodus 21:7. (small chuckles from the guests) She's a Georgetown sophomore, speaks fluent Italian, and always clears the table when it was her turn. What would a good price for her be? While thinking about that, can I ask another? My Chief of Staff, LeoO McGarry, insists on working on the Sabbath, Exodus 35:2, clearly says he should be put to death. Am I morally obligated to kill him myself or is it okay to call the police? Here's one that's really important, 'cause we've got a lot of sports fans in this town. Touching the skin of a dead pig makes us unclean, Leviticus 11:7. If they promise to wear gloves, can the Washington Redskins still play football? Can Notre Dame? Can West Point? Does the whole town really have to be together to stone my brother, John, for planting different crops side by side? Can I burn my mother in a small family gathering for wearing garments made from two different threads?
