VWhy, you want to put out a joint statement...?
p594
sg8
VTOBY
p595
sg10
g15
sa(dp596
g6
VBecause when everyone in the Briefing Room has that Hoynes article, I'm going to be getting bombarded about what Hoynes says you and the President said. And I've got to be sure, word-for-word sure, about what all three of you said and what you didn't say. I can control this story, Leo. I can get us through this, but only if you tell me everything I need you know.
p597

p600
sg8
VLEO
p601
sg10
g15

VI should only talk to the press about this once. I don't want to have to go back out there a second saying, "Oh, yeah, Hoynes was right," about this bit and that bit that you guys forgot to tell me.
p603
sg8

p627
sg8
