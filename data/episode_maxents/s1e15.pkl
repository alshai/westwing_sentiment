VI-I'll give you an example from this week. In fact, the story I'm about to tell you all happened within the last 36 hours. Anyone who's been reading the papers in the last few days has probably been following along with what we call the news cycle that wouldn't end. Depending on how you look at it, it started either with a cabinet secretary losing her temper, a committee chairman baiting her during a hearing, the President answering a question he shouldn't have, a dentist appointment, or me being stupid. [audience laughs] For the record, I'd like to say that I don't think it was as much my fault as other people do. [audience laughs] One thing's for sure, it started out as a day that was supposed to trumpet the President's vision for educational reform.

Then he took a few questions from the press. Now, before I go on, it should be pointed out that according to every poll conducted in the universe, the issue that concerns Americans more than any other is education. Now, The President has just signed off on $700,000,000 in new money for education and announced a plan of aggressive education initiative. What do you suppose the first question from the press was?

VRoberto Mendoza is the President's nominee to fill Crouch's seat on the Supreme Court. The President put Toby Ziegler in charge of his confirmation, which is a huge responsibility. A failed confirmation for the Court is a body blow to a presidency. Besides which, he's a brilliant jurist and we badly want him on the bench. The confirmation process is a tough needle to thread. You gotta make a lot of friends and Supreme Court nominees don't speak before their confirmation, they let the White House speak for them. Something Toby's had a little bit of trouble teaching Roberto Mendoza.

VThe hardest job in the White House is President. The second hardest job is not Chief of Staff, it's not National Security Advisor, and it's not Press Secretary, although I'm gaining a certain amount of respect for Press Secretaries. The second hardest job in the White House belongs to a 21 year old kid named Charlie Young. He's what's called the President's body man, his personal aide. He's with the President morning to night. He has a range of responsibilities, all of them difficult. But the one he hates most in this from time to time it is his job to wake the President up in the morning. And on this particular morning, the President had gone to sleep only three hours earlier.

Judge Mendoza told us that he would see us in three days. Why three days? Because he was driving down to D.C., stopping in Connecticut to do some antiquing. Yet another thing we'd have to tell the President. Who, by the way, had still not woken up.

Can't get it done. Nothing about this that doesn't stink. And nothing about it that wouldn't be better if you were a Supreme Court Justice. Let me take you to the motel. Go see your boy.
