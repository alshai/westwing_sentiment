VI-I'll give you an example from this week. In fact, the story I'm about to tell you all happened within the last 36 hours. Anyone who's been reading the papers in the last few days has probably been following along with what we call the news cycle that wouldn't end. Depending on how you look at it, it started either with a cabinet secretary losing her temper, a committee chairman baiting her during a hearing, the President answering a question he shouldn't have, a dentist appointment, or me being stupid. [audience laughs] For the record, I'd like to say that I don't think it was as much my fault as other people do. [audience laughs] One thing's for sure, it started out as a day that was supposed to trumpet the President's vision for educational reform.

VRoberto Mendoza is the President's nominee to fill Crouch's seat on the Supreme Court. The President put Toby Ziegler in charge of his confirmation, which is a huge responsibility. A failed confirmation for the Court is a body blow to a presidency. Besides which, he's a brilliant jurist and we badly want him on the bench. The confirmation process is a tough needle to thread. You gotta make a lot of friends and Supreme Court nominees don't speak before their confirmation, they let the White House speak for them. Something Toby's had a little bit of trouble teaching Roberto Mendoza.

VThe hardest job in the White House is President. The second hardest job is not Chief of Staff, it's not National Security Advisor, and it's not Press Secretary, although I'm gaining a certain amount of respect for Press Secretaries. The second hardest job in the White House belongs to a 21 year old kid named Charlie Young. He's what's called the President's body man, his personal aide. He's with the President morning to night. He has a range of responsibilities, all of them difficult. But the one he hates most in this from time to time it is his job to wake the President up in the morning.

Yet another thing we'd have to tell the President. Who, by the way, had still not woken up.

VThere's nothing about this that doesn't stink. If it were me, I'd wanna extract vengeance, and I'd say 'Let justice be done.' I'd also wanna spend some time in a dark room alone, so that I didn't have to face my wife and my son and have them see my humiliation. Rob, I can't get this done if this is the story. Can't get it done. Nothing about this that doesn't stink. And nothing about it that wouldn't be better if you were a Supreme Court Justice. Let me take you to the motel. Go see your boy.

VYour lucky night, officers. There isn't gonna be a report, there isn't going to be an investigation, no one's getting suspended. And no one's filing a hundred million dollar lawsuit against the county that they would almost surely win. But in this room, you're gonna apologize to Mr. Mendoza. And then you're gonna get in your squad car and you're gonna follow us and you're gonna apologize to his son.
