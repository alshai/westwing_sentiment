VWell, setting aside Christopher Wick, and I agree with Josh. Someone's getting that wrong. Katzenmoyer and O'Bannon I buy. I'm going to guess the other two are Tillinghouse and LeBrandt. That's what we're going to hear tomorrow. Now the two of them are going to vote together on this, so we're really only going to need to get to one, and whether it's Tillinghouse or LeBrandt, and it should be Tillinghouse, we're gonna need help.

p723
sg8
VTOBY
p724
sg10
g11
sa(dp725
g6
VNo, I understand. But market analysts widely attribute the jump in technology stocks to the testimonies of, among others, your boyhood friend. [incredulously] Are you telling me you didn't know what he was going to say to the committee?
p726
sg8
VLEELA
p727
sg10
g11
sa(dp728
g6
VI'm telling you that not only didn't I know what he was going to say to the committee, not only didn't I care what he was going to say to the committee, but if he had sat in my office while I typed up his testimony for him.

VVotes are expensive. O'Bannon's going to want the farm subsidies revisited, Katzenmoyer's gonna go back to the federal tax exempt metro link. We're talking about unions, defense contracts, possibly agency appointments and my point is that the clock's running, and we're no closer to answering the question.
p771

VL.B.J. never would've taken this kind of crap from Democrats in Congress. He'd have said, 'You're voting my way, in exchange for which, it is possible that I might remember your name.' [stops walking] Pal, we need to win. And I mean win. We need to take a curtain call and a victory lap. And that's how we get momentum. We get it by being tough. We give away nothing. That's what I'm taking to Leo.
