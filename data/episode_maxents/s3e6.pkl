Also appreciated was the visit to the White House by some fifty of your constituents on board a bus that was chartered by your office. Their complaints were respectfully heard by my assistant and I regret that matters escalated to the point where she felt it necessary to call in the Park Police. You'll be happy to know that their bus has been refueled and that the seniors are on their way home, each having been allowed to keep their security tags as a souvenir.

The USS Gudgeon, 1957. Eight Soviet ships caught her, kept her cornered for four days. Oxygen depletion, fainting, migraines, couldn't cook, couldn't light a cigarette.
