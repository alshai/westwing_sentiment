V[gets serious] No, I came at the request of the President. He wanted you to know that he felt that he was rude to you in the Oval Office yesterday. He apologizes if he was abrupt about your problem and while the tightening of your funding was political strategy on our part, he honestly feels that your candidate is a schmuck who gives liberalism a bad name.
