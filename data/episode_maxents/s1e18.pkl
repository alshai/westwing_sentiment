And believe me, if you haven't seen C.J. do 'The Jackal,' then you haven't seen Shakespeare the way it was meant to be done. We're going to watch C.J. do 'The Jackal' and then we're going to get a late dinner, after which I may or may not kiss you good night. 'Cause there is something going on between us, Mallory.

VThe seal, the pyramid, it's unfinished. With the eye of God looking over it. And the words Annuit Coeptis. He, God, Favors our Undertaking. The seal is meant to be unfinished, because this country's meant to be unfinished. We're meant to keep doing better. We're meant to keep discussing and debating and we're meant to read books by great historical scholars and then talk about them, which is why I lent my name to a dust cover. I want to be your Assistant Attorney General for Civil Rights. I'll do an outstanding job for all people in this country. You got any problem with me saying all that to the committee?
