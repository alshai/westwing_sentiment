VBecause it buys things the teachers need. Like textbooks. In a fairly comprehensive study that was done, an alarmingly high number of teachers - forty percent of teachers in Kirkwood, Oregon, for instance, and Kirkwood, Oregon being a fair model for public school districts across the country - forty percent of the teachers in Kirkwood, Oregon report not having sufficient textbooks for their students. [Ainsley is taking notes.] The package offered by the Republican controlled Congress offered a grand total of zero dollars for new textbooks.

I am so off-the-charts tired of the gun lobby tossing around words like 'personal freedom' and no one calling 'em on it.
