p646
sg10

VSo, let me tell you something. Yesterday morning about ten o'clock, these two guys, as a joke, posted some false information on a website about this tiny start-up company, and it's stock started shooting up. By 2:30 in the afternoon, the hoax had been uncovered and the stock had adjusted itself. But by the end of the day this company, which neither you or I or the Secretary of Commerce has ever heard of, closed out as the twelfth highest traded issue on the Nasdaq index. This just in: the Internet is not a fad.

p834
sg8
VMALLORY
p835
sg10
g11
sa(dp836

VWell, uh... like most people, I'm an absolute nut for Chinese opera. The Chinese being known the world over for their soaring and romantic melodies, and what with your guarantee that there won't be sex, I don't see how I could say no.
p837

VSAM
p844

g11
sa(dp845

VHey, you know what's good about this? If you hadn't come along with your offer of Chinese opera and no sex, all I'd be doing later is watching Monday night football, so this works out great for me.
