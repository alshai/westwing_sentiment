VSo, let me tell you something. Yesterday morning about ten o'clock, these two guys, as a joke, posted some false information on a website about this tiny start-up company, and it's stock started shooting up. By 2:30 in the afternoon, the hoax had been uncovered and the stock had adjusted itself. But by the end of the day this company, which neither you or I or the Secretary of Commerce has ever heard of, closed out as the twelfth highest traded issue on the Nasdaq index. This just in: the Internet is not a fad.
