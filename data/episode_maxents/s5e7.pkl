p563

p566
sg8
VJOE
p567
sg10
g11
sa(dp568

VI've just never heard you mention it. Guys around here with two-bit appellate courtships staple it to their foreheads.
p569

VI can't do it, Toby, I'm sorry.

p575
sg8
VTOBY
p576
sg10
g11

g6
VYou want me to do the approach, about getting him to resign.
p578
sg8
VJOE
p579
sg10
g11
sa(dp580
g6
VI didn't say that.
p581
sg8
VTOBY
p582
sg10
g11
sa(dp583
g6
VI can do the math. You've got a limited amount of time to pick the next guy and get him confirmed before the midterms politicize everything. But I work for you. It's a question of propriety.
p584
sg8
VJOE
p585
sg10
g11
sa(dp586
g6
VI see.
p587
sg8
VTOBY
p588
sg10
g11
sa(dp589
g6
VDo you? The White House can't be seen as pressuring a Supreme Court Justice to change his breakfast order, let alone resign. Separation of powers.
p590
sg8
VJOE
p591
sg10
g11
sa(dp592
g6
VI see.
p593
sg8
VTOBY
p594
sg10
g11
sa(dp595

VYou say that, but in a way that makes me wonder if you really do.
p596
sg8
VJOE
p597
sg10
g11
sa(dp598
g6
VThe President sets the direction of the Court. I've read the Constitution too.
p599
sg8
VTOBY
p600
sg10
g11

g6
VHe sets it when there's a vacancy.
p602
sg8
VJOE
p603
sg10
g11

p605
sg8
VTOBY
p606
sg10
g11
sa(dp607
g6
VYou're talking about a guy who stood up to six Administrations, 22 Congresses, and at one time or another had half the country ready to lynch him. You think a former clerk can pry him lose? I got a meeting at the OEOB.
p608
sg8
VJOE

p665
sg8
VCHARLIE
p666
sg10
g11
sa(dp667
g6
VThis is a woman who gets dictators to cry, talk about their love of puppies and momma's cooking, confess they had the concentration camps built because they couldn't get a date for the prom.
p668
sg8
VC.J.
p669
sg10

p671

VCHARLIE
p672

p686

VDONNA
p687
sg10

p692
sg8
VANGELA
p693
sg10
g11
sa(dp694

VSo, the Bermuda Corporation gets a deduction when they buy off their CEO for a hundred million a year. Why not pass a break for a guy like Matt?

p704
sg8
VDONNA
p705
sg10
g11

p713
sg8
VANGELA
p714
sg10
g11
sa(dp715
g6
VI think... our side has done a bad job explaining that what we're fighting for is important. It's not about abstract programs and endless acronyms, but real things that affect real people, like affording college.

p734

VTOBY
p750
sg10
