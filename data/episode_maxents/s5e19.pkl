VTen years ago, I worked for this Senate candidate. He had this idea that health care, pensions, even vacation time ought to be portable, that it should follow you from job to job, 'cause everyone was gonna work 15 jobs in a lifetime. Might as well fly in the teeth of it. And we talked him out of it. We told him he was scaring the bejeesus out of people. Who wants to know about 15 jobs? Maybe we should have done that, I don't know.

VWe can't save your jobs. We are gonna create more in the long run, but we can't save your jobs. It's the short run we gotta figure out. The world's moving faster, we can't stop it. I wish we could. We are gonna do more to prepare you. We have to.
