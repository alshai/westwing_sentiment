VSo, do you know what I'm going to get asked about probably at my first briefing today? The Department of Agriculture report that'll come out this morning saying that commodity prices are down six percent this year, and do I suppose the White House is going to respond to the farmers who are going broke? And I thought, since the Republicans tore up the farm safety net, you might have a good idea for what I should say.

VHelen Baldwin is gonna write a book. She's retained an agent, who sent around a two-page outline, and there's a bidding war. Random House has brought it for low seven figures according to Stu Winkle. Could that possibly be his real name? [reading newspaper] "Baldwin, long a fixture in D.C. and Manhattan Society, whether for her work on charity boards or her position on the arm of some of Wall Street, Washington and Hollywood's most eligble men, as well as hosting some of beltways favorite..." What the hell kind of sentence is this? This is 73-year-old lady who works in the Residence, cleaning and winding all the clocks. She won't retire. She inherited it from her mother who inherited it from her mother. She earns $22,000 a year. She's trusted to walk in and out of rooms where there's personal correspondance, where she can hear if the President and First Lady are having a fight, where she can see people come for secret meetings, and she's been doing this for five decades worth of Presidents. Her name is Mrs. Wheely, and I said, "Mrs. Wheely, you really should write a book," and she said, "No, no, no, we don't do that." 22,000 a year.

Here I am eating a salad, which by the way, you could cover this thing in barbecue sauce and it would still tastes like the ground, and I'm getting heckled from the gallery, who wanted to come in here to eat his roast beef sandwich with ketchup on a kaiser roll and watch the damn tennis on my TV!
