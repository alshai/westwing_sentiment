VBased on federal safety standards, evacuated residents will be allowed to return. But we don't know the full effects of radiation releases. We may not know for months, maybe even years. And we have to be candid about that. And so, while we continue monitoring and testing, we will also help with the relocation of those residents who may not wish to return to San Andreo. Thank you.

It's a political meltdown, for sure. The Santos campaign is declining comment, but they've been flooded with volunteers and donations since the news that Senator Vinick lobbied for the San Andreo nuclear generating station.
