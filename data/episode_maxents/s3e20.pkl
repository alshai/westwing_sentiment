VTwo. Sir, the NSA echelon shows the money originating from an account at the Bank of Commercial Finance in Geneva. The account balance totals a little over 18 million, and we've been able to determine that the account was opened with a transfer from Star of the Levant International. Star of the Levant International is a dummy corporation for Bank Al-Hassan. That's where Colonel Lee takes over.
