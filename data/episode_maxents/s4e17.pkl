He can't live on that, so he puts in another 30 hours as a night watchman, bringing his total to $18,746 a year. He pays 15% in federal income tax or $2,811.90. Public school teacher. $41,724 is the national average. He's paying 28% or $11,682. And, finally, a doctor making 150,000 is paying 36% or $54,000 in taxes. 15%, 28%, 36%. It's called a progressice tax, it's been around since Lincoln. Under the plan the Republicans announced on Friday, the box unloader stays the same, the schoolteacher stays the same, the doctor gets $4,500 back. Under our plan, which has sort of been announced already, the box unloader gets $321 back, the schoolteacher gets $1,251, the doctor stays the same and to finance the tax deductability of college tuition for the chidren of the box unloader and the schoolteacher, we go to a fourth group, the uberwealthy, and ask a CEO making $16,400,000 a year to give us another one percent, taking him up to 41.

VI say, I thought it was courageous. Because the leadership wanted fair pay done quietly, so it didn't become necessary for the moderate Republicans to make it a symbol of left- wing overreaching. Not like the President doesn't have enough problems, but you said, "Screw the leadership." And I think that's courageous. Ironically, I have a hunch that the first lady could have been brought on board fair pay if she had been lobbied more, what's the word, more, you know, professionally. Rather than being embarrased in this morning's newspaper, Alana.
