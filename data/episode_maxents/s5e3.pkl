VI get along with people. They like me in the House because I don't ruffle feathers, and they like me back home because I honestly enjoy a good rubber chicken. Something to do with the cooking I grew up on. And it may look like I'm awful cozy with the mining industry, but West Co. employs five times as many of my constituents as anyone else in my district.
