VI don't think I answered the last one. Suzanne's got me telling jokes. Here's an answer to your question that I don't think you're going to like. A man once said this, "decisions are made by those who show up." So are we failing you, or are you failing us? [hand shake] A little of both. There's a guy on my staff named Charlie Young, he showed me a report from the Center of Policy Alternatives that says that 61% of you agree with the statement "The older generation has failed my generation". When asked how the older generation sees you, your top answers are "lazy", "confused," and "unfocused".

We hold these truths to be self-evident, they said, that all men are created equal. Strange as it may seem, that was the first time in history that anyone had bothered to write that down.
