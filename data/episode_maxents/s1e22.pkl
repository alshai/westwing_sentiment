Your generation is considerably less likely than any previous one to write or call public officials, attend rallies, or work on political campaigns. A man once said this, "decisions are made by those who show up." So are we failing you, or are you failing us? It's a little of both.

There were only 50 people in the world who can't understand why I lied this morning, and they all work in the White House pressroom. I'm sleeping fine tonight.

A man once said this, "decisions are made by those who show up." So are we failing you, or are you failing us? [hand shake] A little of both. There's a guy on my staff named Charlie Young, he showed me a report from the Center of Policy Alternatives that says that 61% of you agree with the statement "The older generation has failed my generation". When asked how the older generation sees you, your top answers are "lazy", "confused," and "unfocused".
