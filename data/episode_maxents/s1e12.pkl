VA story, in which many, if not most of you, are aware of already, will break in wide circulation by the end of the day. I'd like to take this opportunity to read a brief statement before I answer your questions. [starts reading] In June of 1993, I voluntarily admitted myself to the Sierra-Tucson Rehabilitation Facility to treat an addiction to alcohol and Valium. [looks up, cameras flash from everywhere] I am a recovering alcoholic and drug addict. [looks up again] I deeply regret the pain and trouble this has caused for the people in my life. I'd like to, at this point, clarify a few things...

That government, no matter what its failures are in the past, and in times to come, for that matter, the government can be a place where people come together and where no one gets left behind.
