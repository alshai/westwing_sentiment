It's coming from special interests whose interests aren't the same as those who don't have a half a million bucks lying around, and it's not going to party-building. It's going to issue ads.

It is not when it's made after being asked, as in the case of master chief officer Diane Kelli.

VMandy thought it was a pretty accurate analysis, and you know it. You knew she was working for Russell, and you knew why. You knew she had to have written the memo.

You knew there was nothing you could do about it. [pause] You guys are stuck in the mud, around here, and none of it is the fault of the press. I know you're frustrated. But it ain't nothing compared to the frustration of the people who voted for you, so don't come in here and question my...'We'll have a comment for you by the end of the day'?
