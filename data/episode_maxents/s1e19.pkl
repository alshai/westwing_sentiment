VI'm not getting this from morning drive-time radio, Toby. I'm getting this from First Lieutenant Emily Lowenbrau of the U.S. Coast Guard, who would not let me down 'cause she has a very really...a very comforting voice.
p44
sg8
VSAM
p45
sg10

VOkay, here's my thing. If you're wrong, if the coast guard is wrong, the remarks open with 'As I look out over this magnificent vista.' If the event gets moved indoors, he will no longer be looking out over a vista of any kind.

VGood morning. Good morning. We all know each other. Why don't we sit down? We've been conducting meetings with various senior staff on the D.O.D., N.S.C. and House and Senate Armed Services. We feel a little hamstrung because of the policy inherited regarding gays and lesbians in the military. And we'd like as much reform input as possible before making a recommendation to the President.

p798
sg8
VC.J.
p799
sg10
g11
sa(dp800
g6
VSoft money contributions render the 1974 Campaign Reform Act toothless. Soft money contributions, which were ostensibly designed for party-building, whatever that might mean, do nothing but eviscerate any meaningful election controls. We are, by definition, corrupt.
p801
sg8
VJOSH
p802
sg10
g11
sa(dp803
g6
VI wouldn't say that.
p804
sg8
VSTEVE
p805
sg10
g11
sa(dp806
g6
VI know you wouldn't, Steve. This money isn't coming in in 5's and 10's and 20's. It's coming in in denominations of 100, 200, 500 thousand dollars. It's coming from special interests. It's coming from special interests whose interests aren't the same as those who don't have a half a million bucks lying around, and it's not going to party-building. It's going to issue ads. It's going to candidates.
p807
sg8
VJOSH
p808
sg10
g11
sa(dp809
g6
VYeah. It's called free speech, Josh.

sg10
g11
sa(dp812
g6
VIf the insurance company wants to buy ad time from 64 major markets, they are free to do so. If the airplane manufacturing industry wants to back a candidate, they are free to shout from the rooftops. If big tobacco wants to wave a sign or put a bumper sticker on their cars, they are free to do so. That's free speech. Money isn't speech.
p813

p814
sg10
g11

sg10
g11

p841
sg10
g11
sa(dp842
g6
VYeah. So does the Supreme Court, by the way. Uh, Josh, look, we can't have this meeting every time the President wakes up in the morning and decides to make the world better. The party leadership's gonna choose a Republican. The party leadership's gonna choose a Democrat. That's the way it's always been. That's the way it's gonna be. That's the way it is.

It is not a voluntary statement when it's made into a personal diary, as in the case of former West Point cadet Nicole Garrison. It is not when it's made after being asked, as in the case of master chief officer Diane Kelli. And it is not when it is coerced out of a service member through fear...through intimidation, through death threats, in terms of criminal prosecution, as in the case of former Air Force Major Bob Kiddis, former Marine gunnery sergeant Kevin Keys, and four sailors aboard the U.S.S.

You knew there was nothing you could do about it. [pause] You guys are stuck in the mud, around here, and none of it is the fault of the press. I know you're frustrated. But it ain't nothing compared to the frustration of the people who voted for you, so don't come in here and question my...'We'll have a comment for you by the end of the day'?

These people who showed up to fight. [points at Charlie] That guy gets death threats because he's black and he dates your daughter. He was warned: 'Do not show up to this place. You're life will be in danger.' He said, 'To hell with that, I'm going anyway.'

I don't know how much longer.
