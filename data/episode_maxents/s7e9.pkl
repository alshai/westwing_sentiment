VI wouldn't have gotten the money because I would have been in Illinois. The polls there looked as bad as when we were running against Eisenhower. I would have made the same decision as you. And that is exactly what I told Barry Goodwin and George Montgomery. Look, these are tough calls. It's impossible to know how they're going to turn out. What's important is how you respond when you get it wrong, how you react, what your next move is.

VJosh is going to make a lot of strategic decisions over the next few weeks. He's going to sweat them like life and death. And they'll be important, sure, which is why you and me are going to be in on every one of them. But they're meaningless compared to the decision the voters are going to have to make just by listening to you and trying to see if they can connect with the idea of Matt Santos as President. And Josh has nothing to do with that. Goodwin's right: Josh has taken you as far as he can. The rest is up to you.

VYou know, one time during my first term in Congress we went on a Congressional delegation to East Germany. You probably don't remember, you couldn't have been more than four or five. But anyway, we got to East Berlin and we were waiting online with our passports at Checkpoint Charlie when all of a sudden you bolted out into the no-man's land between the two guard posts and everything stopped. The MPs just froze and your mother and I were scared to death, but not you. You just calmly looked up at one of the soldiers on the wall and you waved and the soldier waved back. And then...
