Why would I lie to a journalist of all people?\n\nBILLY\nWhy do you keep looking over my shoulder?\n\nSAM\nWhy?\n\nBILLY\nYes.\n\nSAM\n'Cause Alger Hiss just walked in with my secret pumpkin.\n\nBILLY\nWhat?\n\nSAM\nThere's a woman over there.

You'd be amazed at how normal I can be. See,\nit's all\nabout budgeting your time. This time, this hour, this is my time. Five\na.m. to six\na.m. I can workout, as you see. I can think about personal matters. I can\nmeet an\ninteresting man. [Her beeper goes off.] The trick is...\n\nMAN\nYour beeper's going.\n\nC.J.\nWhat?\n\nMAN\nI think your beeper is going.\n\nC.J. checks her beeper while still running on the treadmill.

A message was just patched up to the cockpit for you. I'm not sure\nI've got it right. POTUS in a bicycle accident?\n\nTOBY\n[stops typing and looks up] You got it right. [reaches for his cell phone]\n\nFLIGHT ATTENDANT 2\nYou can't use your phone until we land, sir.\n\nTOBY\nWe're flying in a Lockheed eagle series L-1011.

Your message -- your pager went off while you were in the\nshower. I hit the button because I thought it was mine.\n\nSam reads the beeper, while Laurie recites the message.\n\nLAURIE\n'POTUS in a bicycle accident. Come to the office.'\n\nSam rushes to get dressed.\n\nLAURIE [cont.]\nI memorized it just in case I erased it on accident. [looks at both her\nand Sam's\npager, comparing them] These things look exactly alike. Anyway, like I\nsaid, I'm\ntotally baked. But um -- no, it's not like I'm a drug person. I just love pot.\n\nSAM\n[slightly preoccupied] Um, Laurie, I to have to go.\n\nLAURIE\nYou're kidding me. It's five thirty in the morning.\n\nSAM\nI know this doesn't look good.\n\nLAURIE\nNot that good. No.\n\nSAM\nYou know what? I really like you. And if you give me your number, I'd like\nto call you.\n\nLAURIE\nStay right here and save yourself a call.\n\nSAM\nIt's not that I don't see the logic in that, but I really gotta go.\n\nLAURIE\n'Cause POTUS was in a bicycle accident?\n\nSAM\nYup.\n\nLAURIE\n[writes her number on a piece of paper, grabs one of the beepers and puts\nthem in\nSam's shirt pocket, while giving him a kiss] Tell your friend, POTUS, he's\ngot a\nfunny name. And he should learn how to ride a bicycle.\n\nSAM\nI would, but he's not my friend, he's my boss; and it's not his name, it's\nhis title.\n\nLAURIE\nPOTUS?\n\nSAM\nPresident of the United States. I'll call you.\n\nCUT TO: INT. THE WHITE HOUSE - NORTHWEST LOBBY - DAY\nLeo walks past several security checks and continues down the hallway.

That's fine. Just don't do anything until Justice.\nOkay, bye. [hangs up the phone] Hey.\n\nLEO\nHow many Cubans, exactly, have crammed themselves into these fishing boats?\n\nJOSH\nIt's important to understand, Leo, that by and large, these aren't fishing\nboats.\nYou hear fishing boats, you conjure an image of -- well, of a boat, first\nof all.\nWhat the Cubans are on would charitably be described as rafts. Okay? They're\nmaking\nthe hop from Havana to Miami in fruit baskets, basically. Let's just be\nclear on that.\n\nLEO\nWe are.\n\nJOSH\nDonna's desk, if it could float, would look good to them right now.\n\nLEO\nI get it. How many are there?\n\nJOSH\nWe don't know.\n\nLEO\nWhat time, exactly, did they leave?\n\nJOSH\nWe don't know.\n\nLEO\nDo we know when they get here?\n\nJOSH\nNo.\n\nLEO\nTrue or False: If I were to stand on high ground in Key West with a good\npair of\nbinoculars, I would be as informed as I am right now.\n\nJOSH\nThat's true.\n\nLEO\nThe intelligence budget's money well spent, isn't it?\n\nThey begin to walk through the busy HALLWAY continuing their conversation.\n\nJOSH\nTell them to send the Coast Guard, Leo.\n\nLEO\nThe Coast Guard won't...\n\nJOSH\nI understand! But, they're never going to make it to our territorial waters.\n\nLEO\nThank you.\n\nJOSH\nWhat if the D.A. suspected they had drugs?\n\nLEO\nDoes the D.A. suspect they have drugs?\n\nJOSH\nWe could make a phone call.\n\nLEO\nJosh!\n\nJOSH\nIf the D.A. or Navy Intel thought the Cubans were bringing in drugs,\nwouldn't we\nhave to go out there and search those rafts with, you know, guns and blankets?\n\nLEO\nYou look like hell. You know that, don't you?\n\nJOSH\nYes. I do. Listen, Leo. Did he say anything?\n\nLEO\nDid he say anything?! The President's pissed as hell at you, Josh. And so am I.\n\nJOSH\n[sighs] I know.\n\nLEO\nYou gotta work with these people. And where the hell do you get off strutting\nyour...\n\nThey are walking through the ROOSEVELT ROOM.\n\nJOSH\nI know.\n\nLEO\nAl Caldwell is a good man.\n\nJOSH\nAl Caldwell wasn't there.\n\nLEO\nI'm saying, you take everyone on the Christian Right, dump them into one\nbig pile,\nand label them 'stupid'. We need these people.\n\nJOSH\nWe do not need these people.\n\nLEO\nJosh.\n\nJOSH\nWe need Al Caldwell. We want Al Caldwell. We do not need John Van Dyke. And\nwe do\nnot need Mary Marsh.\n\nLEO\nAnd I think there shouldn't be instant replay in football, but that' s not\nmy call,\nnow, is it?\n\nJOSH\n[stops walking, while Leo continues on] It was stupid.\n\nLEO\nDamn straight.\n\nJOSH\nI was right, though.\n\nLEO\n[talking to himself] Like I don't know that.\n\nLeo walks into the OUTER OVAL OFFICE where MRS. LANDINGHAM stands up from\nher desk.\n\nMRS. LANDINGHAM\nOh, Mr. McGarry. Have they done an X-Ray?\n\nLEO\nYup.\n\nMRS. LANDINGHAM\nIs anything broken?\n\nLEO\nA $4,000 Lynex Titanium touring bike that I swore I'd never lend anyone.\n\nMRS. LANDINGHAM\n[following Leo into the OVAL OFFICE] I don't understand. How did he...?\n\nLEO\nHe's a klutz, Mrs. Landingham. Your President's a geek.\n\nMRS. LANDINGHAM\nMr. McGarry, you know how I feel about that kind of talk in the Oval Office.\n\nLEO\nI apologize.\n\nMRS. LANDINGHAM\nJust in this room, Mr. McGarry. That's all I'm asking.\n\nLEO\nYes. [walks out of the Oval Office and sees Bonnie] Oh, Bonnie. Call\nO.E.O.B. and\nset up a briefing for the Vice President. Let's coordinate with Katie\nSimon's office\non the appointments.\n\nBONNIE\nShould I get everybody in?\n\nLEO\nYeah! [He walks into his office.] Margaret. Please call the editor of the\nNew York\nTimes crossword and tell him that 'Khaddafi' is spelled with an h, and two\nd's, and\nisn't a seven letter word for anything.\n\nMARGARET\nIs this for real? Or is this just funny?\n\nLEO\nApparently, it's neither.\n\nLEO'S OFFICE. The senior staff is beginning to gather. Several secretaries and\nassistants wonder in and out of the office.\n\nC.J.\nIs there anything I can say, other than the President rode his bicycle into\na tree?\n\nLEO\nHe hopes never to do it again.\n\nC.J.\nSeriously. They're laughing pretty hard.\n\nLEO\nHe rode his bicycle into a tree, C.J.. What do you want me to -- 'The\nPresident,\nwhile riding a bicycle on his vacation in Jackson Hole, came to a sudden\narboreal\nstop' -- What do you want from me?\n\nC.J.\nA little love, Leo.\n\nLEO\n[to Sam] What do you know about the Cubans?\n\nSAM\nI don't know anymore than Josh. Somewhere between 1200 and 2000 Cubans began\nembarking from a fishing village 30 miles South of Havana.\n\nSTAFFER\nWhere are they headed?\n\nJOSH\nVegas.\n\nSAM\nMiami. Though, it's not clear how sophisticated their navigation equipment is.\n\nJOSH\nNavigational equipment? That way is North, I think is pretty...\n\nC.J.\nJosh.\n\nJOSH\nC.J., if one of these guys could throw a split fingered fastball, we'd send\nin the\nUSS Eisenhower.\n\nC.J.\nThat's not entirely true.\n\nTOBY\nOh, for God's sake. Forget about the journey. Okay? The voyage is not our\nproblem.\n\nC.J.\nWhat's our problem?\n\nTOBY\nWhat to do when the Nina, the Pinta, and the Get-Me-The-Hell-Outta-Here\nhit Miami.\n\nLEO\nSam?\n\nSAM\nCan't send them back. They'll go to jail, if they're lucky.\n\nTOBY\nWe'll get whacked in what? At least...\n\nSAM\nThree congressional districts. Dade County.\n\nTOBY\nThose seats are gone.\n\nJOSH\nNot to mention the fact that it's wrong.\n\nSAM\nPlus that.\n\nJOSH\nWhat about Texas?\n\nSAM\nI wouldn't worry about it.\n\nLEO\nKeep Josh in the loop on this throughout the day.\n\nSAM\nMe?\n\nLEO\nYeah.\n\nSAM\nThe thing is, my day is a little tight...\n\nTOBY\nDeal with it.\n\nSAM\nAnd I'm happy to. It's just that...\n\nLEO\nSam.\n\nSAM\nI'm just saying, isn't this more of a military area?\n\nThe room goes silent as everyone digests Sam's argument in shock.\n\nLEO\nMilitary?\n\nSAM\nYeah.\n\nTOBY\nYou think the United States is under attack from 1200 Cubans in rowboats?\n\nSAM\nI'm not saying I don't like our chances.\n\nTOBY\nMind-boggling to me that we ever won an election.\n\nLEO\nPat Thomas wants to call up the Guard.\n\nJOSH\nHe shouldn't.\n\nSAM\nHe's right.\n\nC.J.\nYou send in the Guard, you create a panic situation.\n\nTOBY\nI agree with Josh. And I agree with C.J.. And I agree with Sam. And you\nknow how\nthat makes me crazy.\n\nLEO\nYeah...\n\nTOBY\nThey're running for their lives. You don't have to start a game of Red\nRover with\nCastro. But you don't send in the National Guard. You send food and you\nsend doctors.\n\nJOSH\nSam, see that I.N.S. is working with the Red Cross and the Centers for\nDisease Control.\n\nSAM\nI've got my guy from CDC on the phone right...\n\nLEO\nGo. Talk to him.\n\nSAM\nTalk to him. [leaves]\n\nLEO\nMoving on. Let's talk about Josh.\n\nCUT TO: INT. PRESS ROOM - DAY\nReporters are milling about.

They start to walk\nto the\nBriefing Room.\n\nBILLY\n[continuing] Listen, I had drinks with Sam Seaborn last night.\n\nWOMAN\nAnd Sam said that the President was going to fire Josh?\n\nBILLY\nHe needs these people. He's going to have to give them Josh.\n\nC.J.\n[walks to the podium and begins to address The White House Press Corps]\nFolks? Folks?\n\nWOMAN\nBilly, what do you think if he just--\n\nBILLY\nHe doesn't have a choice.\n\nC.J.\nGood morning.

How\n'bout that!\n\nJOSH\nToby!\n\nTOBY\nI'm in charge of the message around here. It's my job to tell the President\nthat\nthe best thing he could do, from a PR standpoint, is to show you the\ndoor.

He never said anything...\n\nLEO\nHe doesn't believe that it's the government's place to legislate this\nissue. But\nthat has not stopped him from playing his role as a moral leader. Something\nwhich\ncost him dearly in the campaign and you know that.\n\nCALDWELL\nWhy does he insist on demonizing us as a group?\n\nLEO\nBecause your group has plenty of demons.\n\nCALDWELL\n[snorts] Every group has plenty of demons.\n\nLEO\nYou don't have to tell me about it, Reverend.

[walks around the table]\nMy name\nis Sam Seaborn and I'm the Deputy Communications Director. What does that mean\nexactly? Well, to begin with, I'm a counselor to the President, mostly\non domestic\nmatters, though generally not security related. I work with Toby Ziegler, the\nCommunications Director; and C.J. Cregg, the Press Secretary, on crafting our\nmessage and getting it out through the electronic and print media. And while my\nfunctions here are generally perceived to be politically skewed, it's\nimportant to\nremember that it is not the D.N.C., but rather your tax dollars that pay\nmy salary.\nSo I work for you whether you voted for us or not.\n\nThere's an awkward silence in the room before--\n\nMALLORY\nMr. Seaborn, maybe you could give us some history.\n\nSAM\nSure. I graduated law school eight years ago and started working for\nDewey-Ballantine where I--\n\nMALLORY\nActually, I'm sorry to interrupt, actually I meant a history of the building.\n\nSAM\nThe White House.\n\nMALLORY\nYes.\n\nSAM\nSure. [pause] The White House, as you know, was built several years\nago. Mostly, if\nI'm not mistaken, out of cement. The room we're in right now, the Roosevelt\nRoom,\nis very famous. It is named for our 18th President, Franklin Delano\nRoosevelt. The\nchairs that you're sitting on today were fashioned from the lumber of a\npirate ship\ncaptured during the Spanish-American--\n\nThe students are enraptured, but Mallory becomes upset.\n\nMALLORY\n[stands] All right. Kids, I need to speak with Mr. Seaborn. Sit tight for\na second.\n\nSam follows Mallory into the HALLWAY.\n\nMALLORY\nHi.\n\nSAM\nHow ya doin'?\n\nMALLORY\nI'm sorry to be rude, but are you a moron?\n\nSAM\nIn this particular area, yes.\n\nMALLORY\nThe 18th President was Ulysses S. Grant, and the Roosevelt Room was named\nfor Theodore.\n\nSAM\nReally?\n\nMALLORY\nThere's like a six-foot painting on the wall of Teddy Roosevelt.\n\nSAM\nI should've put two and two together.\n\nMALLORY\nYes.\n\nSAM\nLook, the thing is, while there are really a great many things I can speak with\nauthority, I'm not good at talking about the White House.\n\nMALLORY\nYou're the White House Deputy Communications Director and you're not good\nat talking\nabout the White House?\n\nSAM\nIronic, isn't it?\n\nMALLORY\nI don't believe this. [starts to go back into the room, but Sam stops her]\n\nSAM\nWait a minute. Wait. Please. Could you do me favor? Could you tell me which\none of\nthose kids is Leo McGarry's daughter?\n\nMALLORY\nWhy?\n\nSAM\nWell, if I could make eye contact with her, make her laugh, you know, just\nsee that\nshe has a good time, it might go a long way toward making my life easier.\n\nMALLORY\nThese children worked hard. All of them. And I'm not inclined at this moment\nto make\nyour life easier.\n\nSAM\nMs. O'Brian, I understand your feelings, but please believe me when I tell\nyou that\nI'm a nice guy having a bad day. I just found out the Times is publishing\na poll\nthat says a considerable portion of Americans feel that the White House\nhas lost\nenergy and focus. A perception that's not likely to be altered by the\nvideo footage\nof the President riding his bicycle into a tree. As we speak, the Coast\nGuard are\nfishing Cubans out of the Atlantic Ocean while the Governor of Florida wants to\nblockade the Port of Miami. A good friend of mine's about to get fired for\ngoing on\ntelevision and making sense, and it turns out I accidentally slept with\na prostitute\nlast night. Now. Would you please, in the name of compassion, tell me which\none of\nthose kids is my boss's daughter.\n\nMALLORY\nThat would be me.\n\nSAM\nYou.\n\nMALLORY\nYes.\n\nSAM\nLeo's daughter's fourth grade class.\n\nMALLORY\nYes.\n\nSAM\n[pause] Well, this is bad on so many levels.\n\nFADE OUT.\nEND ACT THREE\n* * *\n\nACT FOUR\n\nFADE IN: INT.

Now,\nyesterday morning, on the television program Capital Beat, that contempt\nwas given\na voice... and a face... and a name. [to Josh] I'm referring, of course,\nto you, sir.\n\nJOSH\nYes, I know, and I'm glad you brought that up...\n\nCALDWELL\nI was surprised at you, Josh. I always counted you as a friend.\n\nJOSH\nAnd I'm honored by that, Reverend. First, let me say that when I spoke on the\nprogram yesterday, I was not speaking for the President or this administration.\nThat's important to know. Second, please allow me to apologize. My remarks\nwere glib\n and insulting. I was going for the cheap laugh, and anybody willing to step\n up and\ndebate ideas deserves better than a political punch line. Mary, I apologize.\n\nMARY\n[pause, then turns to Toby] Good then. Let's deal.\n\nTOBY\n[beat] I'm sorry?\n\nMARY\nWhat do we get?\n\nTOBY\nFor what?\n\nMARY\nFor insulting millions of Americans.\n\nTOBY\nWell, like Josh said...\n\nMARY\nI heard what Josh said, Toby, what do we get?\n\nTOBY\nAn apology.\n\nMARY\nSunday morning radio address. Public morals. School prayer or pornography, take\nyour pick.\n\nTOBY\nSchool prayer or pornography?\n\nVAN DYKE\nIt's on every street corner.\n\nTOBY\nI've seen it. Mary...\n\nMARY\nCondoms in the schools.\n\nTOBY\nWhat?!\n\nMARY\nCondoms in the schools.\n\nTOBY\nWell, that's a problem.\n\nMARY\nWhat?\n\nTOBY\n[raising his voice] We have a Surgeon General who says they dramatically\nreduce the\nrisk of teen pregnancy and AIDS.\n\nMARY\nSo does abstinence.\n\nVAN DYKE\nShow the average American teenage male a condom and his mind will turn\nto thoughts\nof lust.\n\nTOBY\nShow the average American teenage male a lug wrench and his mind'll turn...\n\nC.J.\nToby!\n\nMARY\nSchool prayer, pornography, condoms. What's it gonna be?\n\nTOBY\nWe're not prepared to make any sort of deal right now.\n\nJOSH\nSure we are. Mary...\n\nMARY\n[to Josh] My read of the landscape is that you're cleaning out your desk\nbefore the\nend of business today, so I'd just as soon negotiate with Toby if it's all\nthe same\nto you.\n\nCALDWELL\nMary.\n\nMARY\n[to Caldwell] Please allow me to work. [to Josh] It was only a matter of\ntime with\nyou, Josh.\n\nJOSH\nYes.\n\nMARY\nThat New York sense of humor was just a...\n\nCALDWELL\nMary, there no need...\n\nMARY\nReverend, please! They think they're so much smarter. They think it's\nsmart talk.\nBut nobody else does.\n\nJOSH\nI'm actually from Connecticut, but that's neither here nor there. The point\nis, Mary...\n\nTOBY\nShe meant Jewish. [A stunned silence. Everyone stares at Toby.] When she said\n\"New\nYork sense of humor\", she was talking about you and me.\n\nJOSH\nYou know what, Toby, let's just not even go there.\n\nCALDWELL\nThere's been an apology. Let's move on.\n\nVAN DYKE\nI'd like to discuss why we hear so much talk about the First Amendment\ncoming out\nof this building, but no talk at all about the First Commandment.\n\nMARY\nI don't like what I've just been accused of.\n\nTOBY\n[raising his voice] I'm afraid that's just tough, Mrs. Marsh.\n\nVAN DYKE\nThe First Commandment says \"Honor thy Father\".\n\nTOBY\nNo it doesn't.\n\nJOSH\nToby--\n\nTOBY\nIt doesn't.\n\nJOSH\nListen--\n\nTOBY\nNo, if I'm gonna make you sit through this preposterous exercise, we're\ngonna get\nthe names of the damn commandments right.\n\nMARY\nOkay. Here we go.\n\nTOBY\n\"Honor thy Father\" is the Third Commandment.\n\nVAN DYKE\nThen what's the First Commandment?\n\nA booming voice comes from off screen. The camera moves to show PRESIDENT\nJED BARTLET\nwith a cane standing in the doorway with several Secret Service agents.\n\nPRESIDENT JED BARTLET\n\"I am the Lord your God. Thou shalt worship no other God before me.\"\nBoy, those were the days, huh?\n\nEveryone stands.\n\nCALDWELL\nGood afternoon, Mr. President.\n\nBARTLET\nAl. What do we got here, C.J.?\n\nC.J.\nWell, we've got some hot tempers, Mr. President.\n\nBARTLET\nMary.\n\nJOHN VAN DYKE\nMr. President, I'm John Van Dyke.\n\nBARTLET\nYes. Reverend?\n\nVAN DYKE\nMay I ask you a question, sir?\n\nBARTLET\nOf course.\n\nVAN DYKE\nIf our children can buy pornography on any street corner for five dollars,\nisn't\nthat too high a price to pay for free speech?\n\nBARTLET\nNo.\n\nVAN DYKE\nReally?\n\nBARTLET\nOn the other hand, I do think that five dollars is too high a price to pay for\npornography.\n\nC.J.\nWhy don't we all sit down?\n\nBARTLET\nNo. Let's not, C.J. These people won't be staying that long. May I have\nsome coffee,\nMr. Lewis? Al, how many times have I asked you to denounce the practices of\na fringe\ngroup that calls itself The Lambs of God?\n\nCALDWELL\nSir, it's not up to me to...\n\nBARTLET\nCrap. It is up to you, Al. You, know, my wife, Abbey, she never wants me to do\nanything while I'm upset. [a staffer hands him coffee] Thank you, Mr. Lewis. 28\nyears ago, I come home from a very bad day at the State House. I tell Abbey I'm\ngoing out for a drive. I get in the station wagon, and put it in reverse,\nand pull\nout of the garage full speed. [Leo and Sam appear in the doorway and\nquietly enter\ninto the room.] Except I forgot to open the garage door.\n\nBartlet pauses to take a drink of his coffee and smile at Josh, who smiles back\nuncomfortably.\n\nBARTLET [cont.]\nAbbey told me to not drive while I was upset and she was right. She was right\nyesterday when she told me not to get on that damn bicycle while I was\nupset, but\nI did it anyway, and I guess I was just about as angry as I've ever been in\nmy life.\nIt seems my granddaughter, Annie, had given an interview in one of the\nteen magazines.\nAnd somewhere between movie stars and make-up tips, she talked about her\nfeelings on\na woman's right to choose. Now Annie, all of 12, has always been precocious,\nbut she's\ngot a good head on her shoulders and I like it when she uses it, so I couldn't\nunderstand it when her mother called me in tears yesterday. I said, \"Elizabeth,\nwhat's wrong?\" She said, \"It's Annie.\" Now I love my family and I've read\nmy bible\nfrom cover to cover so I want you to tell me, from what part of the Holy\nScripture\ndo you suppose the Lambs of God drew their Divine inspiration when they sent\nmy 12\nyear-old granddaughter a Raggedy Ann doll with a knife stuck through its\nthroat?\n[pause] You'll denounce these people, Al. You'll do it publicly. And until\nyou do,\nyou can all get your fat asses out of my White House. [Everyone is frozen.]\nC.J., show these people out.\n\nMARY MARSH\nI believe we can find the door.\n\nBARTLET\nFind it now.\n\nThe group leaves the room quickly and quietly.\n\nCALDWELL\n[quietly to Leo] We'll fix this, Leo.\n\nLEO\nSee that you do.\n\nBartlet has gone out the side door, through an adjoining room and into THE\nOVAL OFFICE.\nThe staff begins recovering from this last moment and following the President.\n\nJOSH\nOkay, can I just say that, as it turned out, I was the calmest person in\nthe room?\n\nTOBY\nHey...\n\nC.J.\nWay to stay cool.\n\nTOBY\nI am not empowered to auction off the Bill of Rights.\n\nJOSH\nI thought you were going to take a swing at her there.\n\nTOBY\nShe was calling us New York Jews, Josh.\n\nJOSH\nYeah, but being from Connecticut, I didn't mind so much. [They enter the\nOval Office.]\nYou, C.J., on the other hand, were brilliant. I particularly liked the\npart where\nyou said nothing at all.\n\nC.J.\nI'm sorry, Josh, I was distracted. All I could really think about was\nLloyd Russell\nand your girlfriend.\n\nSAM\nMandy and Lloyd Russell?\n\nJOSH\nI'll be puttin' an end to that.\n\nBARTLET\n\"Hello, Mr. President. Did you have a nice trip, sir? How's the ankle, sir?\"\nSeems to me we've all been taking a little break. Thinking about our\npersonal lives\nor thinking about keeping our jobs. Breaks are good. It's not a bad idea\ntaking a\nbreak every now and then. I know how hard you all work.\n\nMARGARET, Leo's secretary, brings Leo a note, which he slips to Bartlet after\nreading it.\n\nBARTLET\n[speaks while reading the note] There was this time that Annie came to me\nwith this\npress clipping. Seems these theologians down in South America were very excited\nbecause this little girl from Chile had sliced open a tomato, and the\ninside flesh\nof this tomato had actually formed a perfect Rosary. The theologians\ncommented that\nthey thought this was a very impressive girl. Annie commented that she\nthought it\nwas a very impressive tomato. I don't know what made me think of that.\n[reporting the information from the slip of paper] Naval Intelligence reports\napproximately 1200 Cubans left Havana this morning. Approximately 700\nturned back\ndue to severe weather, some 350 are missing and presumed dead, 137 have\nbeen taken\ninto custody in Miami and are seeking asylum. [pause] With the clothes on their\nbacks, they came through a storm. And the ones that didn't die want a\nbetter life.\nAnd they want it here. Talk about impressive. My point is this: Break's over.\n\nLEO\nThank you, Mr. President.\n\nThe senior staff say their thanks and begin to leave the office. Josh is\nthe last\nto the door.\n\nBARTLET\nJosh. \"Too busy being indicted for tax fraud\"? [beat] Don't ever do it again.\n\nJOSH\n[quietly] Yes sir. [exits]\n\nBARTLET\n[calls] Mrs. Landingham. What's next?\n\nMRS. LANDINGHAM\nGovernor Thomas and the Majority Leader have asked to be conferenced in and the\ngroup from NASA is assembling for their photo-op. At seven o'clock, you have...\n\nMrs. Landingham continues as the camera moves and shows us an overhead shot\nof the\nPresidential Seal and the Oval Office.\n\nDISSOLVE TO: END CREDITS.\nFADE TO BLACK.\n\nTHE END\n* * *\n\nThe West Wing and all its characters are properties of Aaron Sorkin, John Wells\nProduction, Warner Brothers Television, and NBC.

She honks the car's horn several times. Senator LLOYD\nRUSSELL is one of the three men. He looks at the car and shakes his head. As\nthe traffic light turns green, Mandy drives fast across the street, through\nand against the curb, and leaves her car there.\n\nMANDY\n[yells] Are you crazy?!\n\nShe jumps out of her convertible without opening the door.

I left a job at a top-tier marketing firm\nwhere I had stock options. I come down here and get this guy elected\nPresident.\nBut he went to breakfast this morning, and made a deal at 443 until after the\nmidterm elections.

[Josh, a little weirded out, looks]\n\nBARTLET\nAfter it, therefore because of it. It means one thing follows the other,\ntherefore it was caused by the other, but it's not always true.

I'd been on talent shows with\nmore polish than some of the events around here.\n\nTOBY\nOn talent shows?\n\nJOSH\nAs a kid. Listen...\n\nTOBY\nOn what if?\n\nJOSH\nWe need to double-team him.\n\nTOBY\nIf we bring Sam and C.J. too.\n\nJOSH\nWe need to gang up on.\n\nTOBY\nYes.\n\nJOSH\nWe do it as a gang.\n\nTOBY\nSee you later.\n\nJosh stops walking as Toby continues down the hall.\n\nJOSH\nListen, it's not gonna be Mandy, right?\n\nTOBY\nNope.\n\nJOSH\nAnyone but Mandy.\n\nToby had walked near C.J.'s Office. He sees C.J. as they head off.\n\nC.J.\n'Post hoc ergo propter hoc'?

You're at your best with a pie in the face.\n\nC.J.\nI've been told that.\n\nTOBY\nIn fact, I'd hold back. Keep it in your back pocket.\n\nC.J.\nJanet?\n\nTOBY\nIf you don't like the rhythm of the 'Q' and 'A,' use the Ryder Cup. Just\nfly in\nthe teeth with it.\n\nC.J.\nYeah.\n\nC.J. and Toby walk off.

Uh, a short while ago the Vice President commented on the White House's\nposition on the A3-C3 saying, and I'm quoting from notes, 'This is the time\nwhen the President needs our support.' Can you clarify the language?\n\nC.J.\nNo. I can't, Mike. I haven't spoken with the Vice President today.\n\nMIKE\nThe language seemed strained, doesn't it?\n\nC.J.\n[glances at Toby, then back at Mike] Strange?\n\nMIKE\nStrained. 'This is the time when the President needs our support.'\n\nC.J.\nIt sounds pretty straightforward. I'll tell you what though, if you consult\nthe\nmorning releases, you'll see that in the world of sports, the White House\njust\ngot dissed by 12 guys named Flippy.\n\nLaughter. C.J. looks at Toby, who is smiling at her response. We zoom out of\nthe PRESS ROOM.\n\nC.J.\nWho's got questions?\n\nREPORTER\nC.J., does this have anything to do with the joke, and is the President\nplanning on making an apology?\n\nFADE OUT.\n\nEND ACT ONE\n***\n\nACT TWO\n\nFADE IN: INT. JOSH'S BULLPEN AREA - DAY\nJosh is watching C.J.'s briefing from a nearby television.

She knows I work for the President.\n\nJOSH\nYou don't think that she...\n\nSAM\nNo.\n\nJOSH\nLet me finish...\n\nSAM\nNo, I'm saying no, she wouldn't say anything.\n\nJOSH\nHow do you know?\n\nSAM\nI know.\n\nJOSH\nHow do you know?\n\nSAM\nI know.\n\nJOSH\nYou want to call her again, don't you?\n\nSAM\nLook, I really like her, and she's not what you think.\n\nJOSH\nThe only thing I know about her is she's a call girl. Is she a call girl?\n\nSAM\nYes.\n\nJOSH\nThen so far she's exactly what I think.\n\nSAM\nI just think I left abruptly. I think it was rude.\n\nJOSH\nOh, you're gonna try and reform her, aren't you?\n\nSAM\nNo.\n\nJOSH\nYou are.\n\nSAM\nI just didn't say a proper goodbye that, you know, shows a little respect.\n\nJOSH\nSam...\n\nSAM\nYou know what, you'd like her if you met her, Josh.\n\nJOSH\nYou got to promise me this is never gonna happen, Sam.\n\nDonna knocks and pokes her head in.\n\nJOSH\nYes?\n\nDONNA\nYou're with the Energy Secretary in five minutes.\n\nJOSH\nThanks.\n\nDONNA\nWhat's going on?\n\nJOSH\nNothing.\n\nDONNA\nReally?\n\nJOSH\nYes.\n\nDONNA\nYou're lying?\n\nJOSH\nYes.\n\nDONNA\nSo I should get out?\n\nJOSH\nYes.

[to everyone in general] Thank you. Good luck\neveryone.\n\nHoynes heads for the door as C.J. approaches him.

What's her name?\n\nMORRIS\nAngela's my wife. Corey's our daughter. It's my grandmother's name. She got\nit\nfrom her great aunt, who got it from the first free woman she ever met.\n\nBARTLET\nThat name's got a hell of a past.\n\nMORRIS\nMy family's very proud of its past as you can tell.\n\nBARTLET\nYour wife's beautiful too. How'd you get her to marry you? Did you trick her\nor something?\n\nMORRIS\nHypnosis.\n\nBARTLET\nYeah, I figured. [beat] Morris, I made a joke about golfers yesterday,\nand now\nit consumes the whole damn building.\n\nMORRIS\nOpen your mouth, sir.\n\nBARTLET\nJokes like that are part of my folksy charm, Morris. It's the very heart of\nmy\npopularity.\n\nMORRIS\nDon't you have a job approval rating of like three percent or something?\n\nBARTLET\nOh, we're having some difficulty getting the word out.\n\nCarol comes in and gives Bartlet a file.\n\nBARTLET\nOh, thank you. Is this from this morning, Carol?\n\nCAROL\nYes, sir. [leaves]\n\nBARTLET\n[sighs] So how's my pulse?\n\nMORRIS\nHave you been running up and down the stairs at the Rose Bowl in the past few\nminutes?\n\nBARTLET\nNo.\n\nMORRIS\nThen it's not that good. Cut back on red meat?\n\nBARTLET\nYeah.\n\nMORRIS\nDairy?\n\nBARTLET\nYeah.\n\nMORRIS\nHow about booze?\n\nBARTLET\n[jokingly] Yeah, why not? Two Dewars on the rocks, Mrs. Landingham.\n\nMORRIS\n[smiles] Mr. President...\n\nBARTLET\nI had a meeting this morning with the Joint Chiefs. [beat] I'm an\naccomplished\nman, Morris. I can sit comfortably with prime ministers and Presidents, even\nthe pope. Why is it every time I sit with the Joint Chiefs, I feel like I'm\nback at my father's dinner table.\n\nMORRIS\nI'm a naval officer, sir...\n\nBARTLET\nYou're a naval officer. You're a doctor in a uniform. [beat] It's not like\nI'm\ntotally without experience, you know.\n\nMORRIS\nYes, sir.\n\nBARTLET\nYou're talking to a former governor. I was commander-in-chief of the New\nHampshire National Guard.\n\nMORRIS\nYou guys got into a lot of tough scrapes, did you?\n\nBARTLET\nDidn't have to. We'd just stand on the border and stare you down. Then we'd\nall\ngo for pancakes. Like you had a lot of closed infantry combat training in\npremed, huh?\n\nMORRIS\nHold still just a second.\n\nBARTLET\nWhat is that?\n\nMORRIS\nIt's a flu shot.\n\nBARTLET\nI don't need a flu shot.\n\nMORRIS\nYou do need a flu shot.\n\nBARTLET\nHow do I know this isn't the start of a military coup?\n\nMORRIS\nSir?\n\nBARTLET\nI want the Secret Service in here right away.\n\nMORRIS\nIn the event of a military coup, sir, what makes you think the Secret Service\nis gonna be on your side?\n\nBARTLET\nNow that's a thought that's gonna fester.\n\nMORRIS\nHold still.\n\nMorris gives him the flu shot. Bartlet groans a little, and then holds his\narm\nafter the shot.\n\nBARTLET\nThank you. I'm not comfortable with violence. [beat] I know this country has\nenemies, but I don't feel violent toward any of them. I don't know whether\nthat's a weakness or not, but I think I know how the Joint Chiefs would\nanswer\nthat question.\n\nMORRIS\nLet the chiefs get to know you, Mr. President. They're serious men, naturally\nsuspicious of your leadership. That's what comes from spending a lifetime\ncaught between the devil and the deep blue sea. They're men of character. They\n\nmay not like your rEsumE, but they'll like you personally if you give it\ntime.\n[beat] You have a once in a generation mind, sir. Ultimately, they'll respect\nthat. They'll advise you well and go where you point. Let the chiefs get to\nknow you, sir. In the meantime, you outrank them. So don't worry about it so\nmuch, and cut back on the dairy.\n\nBARTLET\nAnd the red meat.\n\nMORRIS\nAnd the scotch.\n\nBARTLET\nDon't forget your picture. Corey's a beautiful child.\n\nMORRIS\n[looks at picture] Yeah, I know. Look what I'd done.\n\nBARTLET\nYou didn't do nothing, mister. You were a passenger on this one. Your job\nis to\npay the bills, and do what these ladies tell you to do.\n\nMORRIS\nYes, sir.\n\nBARTLET\nAlso, you got to teach her how to whistle. Her mother won't do that.\n\nMORRIS\nRight.\n\nBARTLET\nI'll see you next week, Morris.\n\nMORRIS\nIn two weeks.\n\nBARTLET\nRight. [Morris heads for the door.] Morris?\n\nMORRIS\nYes, sir.\n\nBARTLET\nLook at that picture again. See? The past isn't the only thing your family\ncan\nbe proud of.\n\nMORRIS\n[beat] Yes, sir.\n\nBARTLET\nGo away.\n\nMorris leaves. He passes Leo walking inside with two distinguished men.\n\nLEO\nMr. President, you remember Stuart White and Ray Finley?\n\nBARTLET\nI do, indeed. Mr. White, good to see you.

Know\nwhat we need more than a media consultant?  An economic stimulus package that\ndoesn't look like it was put together at an Amway rally.\n\nJOSH\nYes, but that's not the meeting we're having right now.\n\nLEO\nFair point.\n\nJOSH\nThe Ryder Cup shouldn't have even ended up on our radar screen.\n\nLEO\nThat's right.\n\nJOSH\nSo you'll let us hire a media consultant?

I don't mean to interrupt. I'll just go back to the bar and call\nmy friend, the Assistant U.S. Attorney General, and see if he wants to come\ndown and meet for a drink with me and that woman back there.\n\nLAURIE\nExcuse me. [leaves abruptly]\n\nSAM\n[to man] Good to meet you. [to the other man] Okay.\n\nCUT TO:EXT. WASHINGTON D.C. STREET - NIGHT\nLaurie comes out of the restaurant.

[She stops. Sam helps her put on the coat.] I can't believe\nyou\nsaid that in there. I backed away from you so quietly, Sam. You know I did. I\nnever would have caused you any trouble. And then you come in and you\nbrandish\nthis... by the way, the Attorney General has no jurisdiction here. [walks\nagain]\n\nSAM\nAre you...?\n\nLAURIE\nI break the law in the district. I break the law in Maryland. And from time\nto\ntime, I break the law in Pennsylvania. In my life, I have never committed a\nfederal crime, which is more than I can say for some people in your line of\nwork.\n\nSAM\nYou're absolutely right about that.\n\nLAURIE\nI need a cab. [waves to a cab passing by but it didn't stop]\n\nSAM\nSo I had a pretty good day.\n\nLAURIE\nCongratulations.\n\nSAM\nI feel like more and more I'm putting a role in policy discussions and then\ntoday I...\n\nLAURIE\nWhy did you come and find me tonight?\n\nSAM\nWhat?\n\nLAURIE\nWhy did you call me four times, and then come and find me?\n\nSAM\nI just... to tell you that I had a pretty good day.\n\nLAURIE\nI don't need saving, Sam.\n\nSAM\nYeah, you do.\n\nLAURIE\nAre you aware that I make more money than you do?\n\nSAM\nYou and any kid with a decent paper route.\n\nLAURIE\nAnd you understand that I wasn't abused as a child, that I like what I do?\n\nSAM\nReally?\n\nLAURIE\nThat it's putting me through law school?\n\nSAM\nI wouldn't knock yourself out in torts because there's no state law in this\ncountry that's gonna admit you with a solicitation bust on your record.\n\nLAURIE\nI don't plan on getting busted.\n\nSAM\nAs opposed to the other people that do?\n\nLAURIE\nSam...\n\nSAM\nAnd I gotta tell you... [They stop walking.] I think you look terrific\ntonight.\n\nLAURIE\nThank you.\n\nSAM\nAnd I'm not just saying that because I want my coat back.\n\nLAURIE\nYou're gonna try and change me, arguing, asserting a position every time I\nturn\naround...\n\nSAM\nI'm a lawyer and a speechwriter. I argue for a living, and I'm sought after\nbecause I'm good at it.\n\nLAURIE\nYou humiliated me back there. And you scared me. You understand that?\n\nSAM\nYeah.\n\nLAURIE\nAnd?\n\nSAM\nI guess that's just the way it goes.\n\nLAURIE\nWell, that's not good enough.\n\nSAM\nIt's gonna have to be.\n\nLAURIE\nWhy?\n\nSAM\n'Cause I've decided to become a good friend of yours.\n\nLAURIE\nOh, am I just supposed to strip down for you now?\n\nSAM\nNo.\n\nLAURIE\nReally?\n\nSAM\nReally.\n\nLAURIE\nSo what are we supposed to do?\n\nSAM\nI don't know, but whatever it is, can we do it indoors because I'm from\nSouthern California.\n\nLAURIE\nYeah.\n\nSAM\nGood.\n\nLAURIE\nYou want to buy me a drink?\n\nSAM\nI have to say, that sounded very professional to me.\n\nLAURIE\nShut up.\n\nSAM\nOkay.\n\nThey start walking, but this time, we don't follow them.\n\nLAURIE\nSo you're gonna reveal state secrets?\n\nSAM\nTo be honest with you, I don't think I know any state secrets.\n\nLAURIE\nNow, he tells me.\n\nSAM\nI can recite the members of Congress in alphabetical order.\n\nLAURIE\nOoh, geez, Sam. How do the girls stay on their feet with you?\n\nSAM\nAnd I got some patter with the capital gains tax, too.\n\nLaurie laughs as they continue to walk away.\n\nCUT TO: INT. THE WHITE HOUSE - HALLWAY - NIGHT\n3:35 A.M.\nThere is an unusual crowding in the White House hallways at this time of\nnight.\nThere are numbers of staffers walking. Among them, we see Toby coming in the\nRoosevelt Room.\n\nCUT TO: INT. THE WHITE HOUSE PORTICO - NIGHT\nPresident Bartlet, wearing a sweatshirt and jeans, walks towards the Oval\nOffice. He passes by a Secret Service Agent, who whispers to the mike on his\nwrist.\n\nAGENT\nEagle's by.\n\nCUT TO: INT. THE ROOSEVELT ROOM - NIGHT\nLeo and Josh are with several military officers.\n\nJOSH\nSo they'll be in position in two hours?\n\nOFFICER 1\nAnd they'd be booked up by a second carrier group plus the F-14s off the\nGeorge\nWashington and the Carlston.\n\nLEO\nHow long before an estimated B.D.A.?\n\nOFFICER 2\nTen minutes.\n\nAGENT\n[walks up from behind Leo] The President's waiting.\n\nLEO\nExcuse me, gentlemen. [heads for the door]\n\nJOSH\nLeo, do you need me?\n\nLEO\nNo.\n\nLeo leaves. We see Toby and Sam looking on in the other end of the room.\n\nCUT TO: INT. THE OVAL OFFICE - NIGHT\nThe President is leaning on his desk. Leo comes in and walks slowly toward\nhim.\n\nLEO\nMr. President, Morris Tolliver is dead.\n\nThe bad news hits the President hard.\n\nLEO [cont.]\nAn airforce transport carrying Morris, 1200 other doctors, 42 support staff,\nand a crew of five to a teaching hospital in Amman exploded in midair about\n150 miles north of Tartus. What was first thought to be a mechanical failure\nwas then claimed by a fundamentalist group after a keyhole satellite sent\nback\na record of a heat stream coming from what's called an F.I.M. 92, which is a\nshoulder-mounted surface-to-air missile launcher. In the last 90 minutes or\nso\nthat's been debunked as well. Hard intelligence is telling us the order came\nfrom the Syrian defense ministry. Baker and Lennox are on their way from the\nPentagon, and Brodie's in the Situation Room preparing for your briefing.\n\nBartlet takes a moment before he speaks.\n\nBARTLET\nWhat time is it?\n\nLEO\nIt's 10:38 in Damascus.\n\nBARTLET\nWhere is the Syrian ambassador?\n\nLEO\nHe's at his residence on a secure phone line.\n\nBARTLET\nTel Aviv and London?\n\nLEO\nState's waiting for your word.\n\nBARTLET\nAlright, uh... [big sigh] I'm gonna call Morris' wife now. I'll meet you in\nthe\nSituation Room.\n\nLEO\nYes, sir. [heads for the door]\n\nBARTLET\nLeo?\n\nLeo turns around.\n\nBARTLET\nI am not frightened. I'm gonna blow them off the face of the earth with the\nfury of God's own thunder. [beat] Get the commanders.\n\nA look of concern is on Leo's face. He slowly turns around, opens the door\nand leaves. From the portico, we see Bartlet walking around behind his desk.\nHe sits on his chair and lets out a big sigh. He then picks up the phone and\nmakes the call.\n\nDISSOLVE TO: END TITLES.\nFADE TO BLACK.\n\nTHE END\n* * *\n\nThe West Wing and all its characters are properties of Aaron Sorkin, John\nWells Productions, Warner Brothers Television, and NBC.
