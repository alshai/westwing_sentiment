JOSH
pos
[into phone] Yes... Yes... Yes... So are you prepared at this point to...

JOSH
pos
[into phone] Thank you. Thank you, sir. Uh, if you'll sit by the phone for a few minutes, you can expect a call from the president. Thank you again. [hangs up the phone slowly]

C.J.
pos
YES!

JOSH
pos
It's done.

C.J.
pos
We did it!

JOSH
pos
It is done!

C.J.
pos
It's done!

DONNA
pos
Who did it?

C.J.
pos
We did it!

JOSH
pos
I did it! C.J. was on the phone with her fingers crossed.

C.J.
pos
All you did was just one phone call.

JOSH
pos
It was a series of phone calls, which I masterminded, while I'm not one to be selfish about credit, I think it is important to know that it is done, and I DID IT! Donna, call Toby. Call Sam. Call Leo. Call the president. Tell them I'm on my way over.

C.J.
pos
Congratulations!

JOSH
neu
Nothing to the press.

C.J.
pos
Yes. [starts to walk away]

JOSH
pos
Claudia Jean?

C.J.
pos
Yeah?

JOSH
pos
We did it!

C.J.
pos
Yeah!

DONNA
neu
Wait!

JOSH
neu
What?

DONNA
neu
Don't you want to know about the banging in your office?

JOSH
neu
Banging in my office?

DONNA
neg
They've been at it all morning.

JOSH
neu
Banging?

DONNA
neg
Yeah.

JOSH
neg
I don't know what you're talking about.

DONNA
neg
Josh, there's a loud banging or thumping coming from the floor above your office.

JOSH
neg
I didn't notice.

DONNA
neg
How could you not notice?

JOSH
neg
Because I didn't, Donna. I've been on the phone for the last hour trying to seal the deal to fill a seat on the Supreme Court.

DONNA
neg
It was a pretty loud banging, Josh.

JOSH
pos
You got to understand I'm talking about the United States Supreme Court right?

DONNA
neu
Yes.

JOSH
pos
Okay.

SAM
pos
Who da man?

TOBY
pos
You da man!

DONNA
neg
This is just gross.

JOSH
neu
Wait there for me.

TOBY
pos
Good morning, Mrs. Landingham.

JOSH
pos
Good morning!

SAM
pos
Good morning, indeed.

JOSH
pos
Yes, Mrs. Landingham?

JOSH
pos
Well, that depends on your answer to this question, Mrs. Landingham: Who da man?

JOSH
pos
Hmmm... Who da man?

TOBY
pos
You da men.

JOSH
pos
Thank you.

BARTLET
pos
I heard we may have...

JOSH
pos
Yes sir.

BARTLET
pos
I can call him?

JOSH
pos
He's waiting for you sir.

BARTLET
pos
It's done?

JOSH
pos
Done.

LEO
pos
You got yourself a Supreme Court nominee, Mr. President.

BARTLET
pos
This is huge. Which one of you is the man?

TOBY
pos
On this one, we'd like to think of ourselves collectively as the men, sir.

BARTLET
neu
Mrs. Landingham, let's make the phone call!

JOSH
pos
Congratulations.

BARTLET
pos
Thank you. You too. [They shake hands.]

SAM
pos
Well done, sir.

BARTLET
pos
Thank you.

MANDY
pos
You guys rock.

SAM
pos
Oh, we really do.

LEO
neu
Let's bring in the chairman and the ranking member from judiciary, the leadership from both sides, and C.J. you should...where is C.J.?

C.J.
neu
[comes in behind Leo] Right here.

LEO
neu
[turns around] Oh.

C.J.
neu
Sorry.

LEO
neg
You should wear a bell around your neck, you know that?

C.J.
pos
Thank you.

LEO
neu
So what do we want to we do?

TOBY
neu
C.J. will let the press know that the president will introduce his nominee in an east room press ceremony Thursday, 5 p.m.

JOSH
neu
Can we do it on Friday, and give ourselves more time?

TOBY
neu
Thursday.

JOSH
neu
Why?

SAM
neu
Because that's when people watch T.V.

MANDY
neu
We can do this in four days?

TOBY
neu
Yep.

LEO
neu
Are you sure?

TOBY
neu
Yep.

LEO
neu
Toby, you're running the show.

TOBY
neu
I know.

LEO
neu
Put the ball in the hole.

TOBY
neu
It's done.

LEO
neu
No, it's not. So get it done.

TOBY
neu
Yes sir.

TOBY
neu
Josh, get me everything.

JOSH
neu
We vetted him two months.

TOBY
neu
I'm gonna vet him four more days. I want to know every parking ticket. I want to know every girlfriend he stood up for dinner in 1953. Mandy, you're gonna roll this guy out on a show that makes the queen's coronation look like dinner theater. Sam, you're gonna write the president's introduction. You're also gonna write the Harrison's remarks.

SAM
neu
Harrison's not gonna like that.

TOBY
pos
Show him the robe he gets. He'll like it fine.

TOBY
neg
C.J., no leaks. If the name of this nominee is leaked out before I want it to be leaked out, I'm gonna blame you, and you're gonna find that unpleasant.

C.J.
pos
I got to tell you something, Toby. You're hot when you're like this.

TOBY
pos
[yells] I am gonna put Harrison on the Court! I swear to God I am!

JOSH
neu
We meet again three hours.

MANDY
neu
C.J., come talk to me.

SAM
pos
Did you see his face?

JOSH
pos
We're home.

SAM
pos
I'll see you later.

DONNA
neu
It's a maintenance crew.

JOSH
pos
The banging?

DONNA
neg
They're working upstairs.

JOSH
pos
Peyton Cabot Harrison III.

DONNA
neg
Yes.

JOSH
pos
Peyton Cabot Harrison III. He sounds like he should be a Supreme Court justice.

DONNA
neu
It's a good name.

JOSH
pos
Phillips Exeter, Princeton, Rhodes scholar, Harvard Law Review, for which he was, oh yeah, the editor. Did I mention that he was dean of Harvard Law School? Did I mention that his father was attorney general to Eisenhower?

DONNA
neg
Peyton Cabot Harrison III.

JOSH
pos
That's right.

DONNA
neg
Jewish fellow?

JOSH
neg
You're not gonna ruin this moment for me, Donna.

DONNA
neg
I'm sharing this moment with you.

JOSH
pos
This is a big day for us.

DONNA
neg
You're the men.

JOSH
pos
You know what we're finally gonna have?

DONNA
neg
A waspy old man in the Supreme Court?

JOSH
pos
A smooth confirmation process.

DONNA
neg
You think?

JOSH
pos
It's gonna sail.

DONNA
neg
I hope so.

JOSH
pos
It's gonna sail, Donna.

DONNA
neg
There's many a slip twixt the tongue and the wrist, Josh.

JOSH
pos
Yes. Well, your fortune cookie wisdom notwithstanding, it's gonna sail.

DONNA
neg
Please don't get your hopes up.

JOSH
neg
Why shouldn't I get my hopes up?

DONNA
neg
Because when it doesn't work out, you end up drunk in my apartment in the middle of the night and yell at my roommate's cats.

JOSH
pos
Smooth sailing, Donna.

DONNA
neg
Cautious optimism, Josh.

JOSH
neg
Nothing bad is gonna happen this week.

DONNA
neu
Exercise cautious optimism.

JOSH
neg
Look, there is no reason...

JOSH
neu
Well... okay.

BARTLET
pos
You're too young to retire, Joseph.

CROUCH
neg
[laughs] You're an excellent liar, Mr. President.

BARTLET
neu
[chuckling] Yes sir.

CROUCH
neu
You're gonna go with Harrison?

BARTLET
neu
He's on the short list.

CROUCH
neu
Yeah?

BARTLET
neu
Yeah.

CROUCH
neg
With how many other names?

BARTLET
pos
We'll make our announcement on Thursday.

CROUCH
neg
You've decided on Harrison.

BARTLET
neu
I haven't made a decision yet, Joseph.

CROUCH
neg
You've made the call. [beat] Did you even consider Mendoza?

BARTLET
pos
Mendoza was on the short list.

CROUCH
neg
Mendoza was on the short list so you can show you had an Hispanic on the short list.

BARTLET
neu
That's not true, Joseph.

CROUCH
neg
You ran great guns in the campaign. It was an insurgency, boy, a sight to see. And then you drove to the middle of the road the moment after you took the oath. Just the middle of the road. Nothing but a long line painted yellow.

BARTLET
neg
Excuse me, sir...

CROUCH
neg
I wanted to retire five years ago. But I waited for a Democrat. I wanted a Democrat. Hmm! And instead I got you.

DANNY
neu
Hey.

C.J.
neu
Hey.

DANNY
pos
How you doing?

C.J.
neg
I'm doing fine, Danny.

DANNY
neu
Is it gonna be Harrison?

C.J.
neg
Why, why, oh why do you ask me questions that you absolutely, positively know I'm not gonna answer?

DANNY
pos
It's a good conversation starter.

C.J.
neg
I can't go out on a date with you, Danny.

DANNY
neu
Who asked you?

C.J.
neu
Okay.

DANNY
neu
You think Harrison is gonna be a good Justice?

C.J.
neg
Danny?

DANNY
pos
You see what I did there?

C.J.
neu
Yeah.

DANNY
pos
I tried to trick you into confirming it was Harrison.

C.J.
neu
Yes.

DANNY
pos
It didn't work.

C.J.
neu
No.

DANNY
pos
And you won't go out on a date with me, right?

C.J.
pos
Right.

DANNY
neu
Okay.

BARTLET
neu
I suppose we should get out there.

CROUCH
neg
Not yet, sir.

BARTLET
neg
I'm sorry Joseph, but I am...

CROUCH
neg
I've served on this bench for 38 years. I took my seat the year you began college. I believe I've earned the right to say a word.

BARTLET
neu
You've said quite a few words.

CROUCH
neg
Not enough.

BARTLET
pos
Let's get out there.

CROUCH
neg
Take the next few days with your staff, and give Mendoza the consideration he deserves.

BARTLET
pos
Joseph, when the next seat opens up, I promise you...

CROUCH
neg
When the next seat opens up, you'll be writing your memoirs.

BARTLET
pos
In three years, I would hope to be running for reel...

CROUCH
neg
You're gonna get beat in three years.

BARTLET
neg
That's a little pessimistic, Joseph.

CROUCH
neg
American voters like guts. And Republicans have got them. In the three years, one of them is gonna beat you.

BARTLET
neg
You know I imagine the view from your largely unscrutinized place in history must be very different from mine. But I remind you sir, that I have the following things to negotiate: an opposition Congress, special interests with power beyond belief, and a bitchy media.

CROUCH
neg
So did Harry Truman.

BARTLET
neg
Well, I am not Harry Truman.

CROUCH
neg
Mr. Bartlet, you needn't point out that fact.

BARTLET
neg
[beat] It's 'Dr. Bartlet,' your honor. Now, let's go start your retirement.

DANNY
pos
Want my gloves?

C.J.
neu
No, thanks.

DANNY
pos
I asked because you look pretty cold.

C.J.
neg
I'm fine.

DANNY
pos
What do you suppose they're talking about in there?

C.J.
neu
The president and Justice Crouch are old friends.

DANNY
neu
The president and Justice Crouch can't stand each other.

C.J.
neu
The man's retiring today. It's a courtesy call. What do you want from me?

DANNY
pos
Dinner and a movie.

C.J.
neu
No.

DANNY
pos
You think Crouch is pissed because the president has already settled on Harrison?

C.J.
pos
Danny?

DANNY
pos
I did it again!

C.J.
pos
Yeah.

DANNY
pos
But you know what you did?

C.J.
pos
What?

DANNY
pos
You outfoxed me.

C.J.
pos
You're killing me. You know that, Danny.

WOMAN
neu
Here we go.

JOSH
neu
That was inches from my head.

DONNA
neg
Josh.

JOSH
neg
Inches.

DONNA
pos
It was not inches.

JOSH
pos
It was inches. A little bit this way, a little bit that way, bam! Massive head wound.

DONNA
neu
You're fine.

JOSH
neu
Yeah, but there for the grace of God, you know what I'm saying?

DONNA
neu
Yes.

JOSH
pos
I really think if big chunks of ceiling are gonna fall on anyone... I don't know...

DONNA
pos
What?

JOSH
pos
It should be you.

DONNA
pos
Ugh. I knew you were gonna say that.

JOSH
pos
From now on, before I come in in the morning, I want you to test my office.

MANDY
neu
[comes up] Josh?

DONNA
neu
Staff in ten minutes. [leaves]

JOSH
neu
You see this?

MANDY
neu
Yeah.

JOSH
pos
Inches from my head.

MANDY
neg
Why is Peter Lillienfield holding a press conference?

JOSH
pos
Who cares?

MANDY
neg
I do. Why is Lillienfield holding a press conference?

JOSH
neg
I don't know.

MANDY
neg
Is he unhappy about something?

JOSH
neg
He's always unhappy about something. [calls] Donna! Where's my east Asia memo?!

MANDY
neg
It starts in two minutes.

JOSH
neu
What starts in two minutes?

MANDY
neg
Lillienfield's press conference.

JOSH
neg
[shouts] It's okay, Donna. I'll just come and get it myself!

MANDY
neu
Josh?

JOSH
neu
Mandy.

MANDY
neu
I'm just saying that we don't need any surprises today.

JOSH
neg
We're not gonna have any surprises today.

MANDY
neg
I'm putting on a show. I don't want to get upstaged.

JOSH
neg
You're not gonna get upstaged.

DONNA
neu
Here.

JOSH
neu
Thank you.

DONNA
neg
You're welcome.

JOSH
pos
You should be nice to me. I could be dead you know.

DONNA
pos
I don't have that kind of luck. [leaves]

SAM
neu
Yeah?

TOBY
neu
I would like you to play out that as a lifelong Democrat, he clerked for a Republican. I would like you to play DOWN that he'd never written a judicial opinion on abortion or revealed his thinking on Roe.

SAM
pos
I'm already there.

TOBY
pos
Well, thank you.

SAM
neu
What's this?

TOBY
neg
Lillienfield's talking about something that's bothering him today.

SAM
neg
WHAT could possibly be less interesting? I'll be in my office.

TOBY
neu
Okay.

TOBY
neg
[into phone] Get her.

CAROL
neu
C.J.?

C.J.
neu
Tell him I'm watching.

LEO
neg
One in three?

C.J.
neu
Yes.

LEO
neg
He said one in three White House staffers were on drugs?

C.J.
neu
Yes.

LEO
neg
Where does he get these stats?

C.J.
neg
Leo...

LEO
neg
I mean where does he pull them from?

C.J.
neg
Out of the clear blue sky, but that doesn't matter.

LEO
neg
Is somebody bringing me a tape of this?

MARGARET
neu
They're getting it. [leaves]

MANDY
neg
This isn't happening to me.

LEO
neu
Nothing's happening. Stay cool.

SAM
neg
[pops his head and walks in] Is it possible for Peter Lillienfield to be a bigger jackass? You think if he tried hard, there's room for him to be a slightly bigger horse's ass than he's being right now?

C.J.
neg
At some point, you hit your head in the ceiling, don't you?

SAM
pos
I think there's unexplored potential.

JOSH
pos
[comes in] 'Sup?

MANDY
neu
Josh.

JOSH
pos
Five White House staffers in the room. I would like to say to the 1.6 of you who are stoned right now, that it's time to share.

MANDY
neg
This isn't funny, Josh.

JOSH
pos
Mandy, if you can't laugh at this, then you're just not having enough fun in show business.

MANDY
neg
Josh?

JOSH
pos
He's a featherweight, Mandy. He's a hairdo.

SAM
pos
I think if he put his shoulder into it, he could be a slightly bigger gasbag.

JOSH
pos
Yeah.

SAM
pos
You know, if he really reach for the stars.

TOBY
neu
[quickly walks in] Good morning.

C.J.
neu
Hey.

TOBY
neg
There's no way you saw this coming?

LEO
neg
Toby...

TOBY
neg
Leo, I know I'm in your office. Forgive me. [yells] But nobody saw this coming?!

C.J.
neg
Yeah. I can't believe my psychic didn't tell me, Toby. Rest assured, I'm gonna get my twenty bucks back.

LEO
neu
Short-term, long-term?

JOSH
pos
Short-term nothing.

C.J.
neg
I can't go with nothing.

JOSH
neu
Why not?

C.J.
neg
Pretend we didn't see it?

JOSH
pos
He's a liar. He's a fool. Categorically deny it and move on.

MANDY
neg
She can't.

C.J.
neg
I can't.

JOSH
pos
Why not?

C.J.
neg
Because more than 1300 people work for the White House, Josh. I go to the Press Room and categorically deny that anyone uses drugs, and it turns out that three guys in the photo lab blew a joint over the weekend, which is not like out of the realm of possibility. And my next question is...

MANDY
neg
But you categorically denied it, now you admit there are three.

C.J.
neg
Yes. Well, I categorically deny that there are any more than three.

MANDY
neg
But now it seems that the assistant to the deputy director of White House beverages--

JOSH
neg
All right.

MANDY
neg
--is confessing to a life of a closet junkie.

C.J.
neg
Yes, and I understand she's selling her story to Random House for a middle six-figure advance.

TOBY
neg
[now has his head against the wall] All right. Are we done with Masterpiece Theater?

LEO
neu
C.J., we're looking into it, okay?

C.J.
neu
Yeah.

LEO
neu
That's what we're saying right now.

JOSH
neg
I don't care if we say that, but... we're not actually looking into it, are we?

LEO
neu
Yes.

JOSH
neg
This is a joke, right?

MARGARET
neu
[walks in] Leo?

LEO
neu
Yeah? Toby. [points at the staff]

TOBY
neu
Yeah.

TOBY
neu
C.J., go do your briefing. The president paid a courtesy call on Crouch this morning. We got some exciting names. On the short list is Ed Harrison. We'll introduce the nominee Thursday, 5 o'clock. This business with Lillienfield...

C.J.
neu
I've heard about it, and I'd like the chance to see it first before I comment.

TOBY
neu
Is the president aware?

C.J.
neu
We'd like to keep this things off the president's desk until we measure what, if any, credibility...

TOBY
pos
Good girl.

MANDY
neg
Toby, if the alternative is getting Harrison bumped off the top story...

TOBY
neu
We're not gonna postpone.

MANDY
neu
Let's end this fast.

JOSH
neu
How?

MANDY
neu
You know how.

JOSH
neg
No, I don't.

SAM
neu
Mandy.

MANDY
neg
What I'm saying...

TOBY
neg
Go back to work, Mandy.

JOSH
neg
Now, hang on a second. I'd like to hear what-

TOBY
neg
Hey! Go back to work.

MANDY
neg
Lillienfield is walking on a stage, and he's not gonna get off until he gets off is what I'm saying.

JOSH
neg
We are not taking drug tests.

MANDY
neg
Why not?

JOSH
neg
Because we're not!

MANDY
neg
Toby, let's end this.

JOSH
neg
Toby, if you...

TOBY
neg
Shut up. [to Mandy] Go. [Mandy leaves.] Sam, go back to doing what you're doing.

SAM
neu
They just delivered five cartons of Harrison's old papers.

TOBY
neu
Then go start reading.

JOSH
neg
Toby...

TOBY
neu
What do we know? What do they know?

JOSH
neg
Now, wait, hang on a second.

TOBY
neg
Josh...

JOSH
neg
You're not making me--I'm not gonna be the internal affairs cop around here.

TOBY
neg
Yes, you are.

JOSH
neg
You want to know who's doing what around here, you ask them yourself!

TOBY
neg
This isn't the time, Josh. We taking water over the side...

JOSH
neg
Yes, and I'm not indifferent to that, but there's a principle here-

TOBY
neg
No, there's not. Not this week. We've been doing this for a year, and all we've gotten is a year older. Our job approval's 48%, and I think that number's soft, and I'm tired of being the field captain for the gang that couldn't shoot straight! We're getting this done! [beat] What do we know? What do they know? Start with me, if you want.

SAM
neu
Hello? This is Sam Seaborn. [listens] What's your name? Uh, I'm not a cop. What's your name? [listens] Where are you right now? [listens] All right. I'm the only one in my office, but as soon as the secretary get--you know what? Hang on. I'm on my way. [hangs up the phone, wears his jacket, heads out, and trips over one of the cartons] Ow!

BARTLET
pos
A quick confirmation's gonna be good for us.

LEO
pos
Ritter says we'll get unanimous approval out of committee and 90 votes in the Senate.

BARTLET
pos
That's a blowout, Leo.

LEO
pos
Mm-hmm.

BARTLET
pos
Just what the doctor ordered. [An agent opens the door.] Thank you.

BARTLET
pos
Good morning, Mrs. Landingham.

LEO
pos
Good morning.

BARTLET
neu
When is Harrison getting in?

LEO
neu
Late tonight.

BARTLET
pos
Good.

BARTLET
pos
Good morning, Charlie.

CHARLIE
pos
Good morning, Mr. President.

LEO
pos
Good morning.

BARTLET
pos
Peyton Cabot Harrison. Find out what kind of cigars he likes, what kind of perfume his wife likes, and have them sent over to their hotel, okay?

CHARLIE
neu
Back channels, sir?

BARTLET
pos
Yeah.

LEO
neu
They're gonna stake the hotels. Gifts coming from the White House...

BARTLET
neu
We're using back channels. What is going on with Lillienfield?

LEO
neu
You're staying out of it.

BARTLET
neu
Fine.

LEO
neu
Anything else?

BARTLET
pos
We're gonna get this done, right?

LEO
pos
Yes sir.

BARTLET
pos
All right.

BARTLET
pos
I'm on my way.

LEO
pos
Thank you, Mr. President.

BARTLET
pos
Thank you.

BARTLET
neu
Leo?

LEO
neu
Yes, sir?

BARTLET
neu
We looked at everybody, right?

LEO
neu
Sir?

BARTLET
neu
The short list. We looked at Mendoza?

LEO
neu
We looked at him.

BARTLET
neu
Leo...

LEO
neu
We fixed on Harrison.

BARTLET
pos
Yeah, you're right. I'll see you later.

LEO
pos
Yes sir.

BARTLET
neu
Good morning, gentlemen. Sorry to keep you waiting. Let's go.

BARTLET
pos
Good morning. Good morning. Hang on a second.

BARTLET
pos
Good morning. Keep your seats.

BARTLET
pos
Good morning.

BARTLET
pos
Good morning, Toby.

TOBY
pos
Good morning, sir.

BARTLET
neu
Do this for me. Put together some information on Roberto Mendoza.

TOBY
neu
Sir... it's natural to have second thoughts, but...

BARTLET
neu
No. I just want to be able to know something. There's gonna be a lot of questions. I don't want it to be 'we had a Hispanic on the short list.'

TOBY
neu
What is it you're looking for?

BARTLET
neu
The reason we didn't go with him.

TOBY
neu
The reason we didn't go with him is because Harrison said yes.

BARTLET
pos
Let's do better than that.

TOBY
neu
Yes sir.

BARTLET
pos
Uh, what's going on with this drug thing?

TOBY
neu
You don't want a piece of that.

BARTLET
pos
All right. I'll trust ya. Thank you.

SAM
pos
[passes by] Good morning, sir.

BARTLET
pos
Good morning, Sam.

SAM
neu
Toby.

TOBY
neg
He wants me to look at Mendoza. What...?

SAM
neg
[slams an envelope on Toby's desk] I got a phone call before from a guy with some information. I just picked it up. I read it on the way back. It's not good.

TOBY
neu
Is it the drugs?

SAM
neg
No.

TOBY
neg
What is it?

SAM
neg
It's Harrison.

TOBY
neu
Close the door.

SAM
neu
It's called an unsigned note. Every member of Law Review is required to prepare one. It's like an article.

TOBY
neg
I know what an unsigned note is.

SAM
neu
It's 40 or so pages, well researched, footnoted, and revised with faculty supervision, and it's published.

TOBY
neu
Without the names.

SAM
neu
Without the names. It's scholarly work.

TOBY
neu
How do we know Harrison...?

SAM
neg
Toby...

TOBY
neg
What, I'm supposed to just trust 'the guy on the phone?'

SAM
neg
I spent the last three months reading everything Harrison's written, from decisions, to memos, to amacus briefs, Toby. He's the author of the unsigned note.

TOBY
neu
[pause, calls] Bonnie!

BONNIE
neu
[opens the door] Yeah?

TOBY
neu
I'm gonna need the next five minutes the president's got.

BONNIE
neu
Yeah.

DONNA
neu
How does Lillienfield get his information?

JOSH
neg
Ah, he's got a half government oversight committee. These are the people who literally decide if we get heat and electricity in the White House.

DONNA
neu
So they have access to background information?

JOSH
neg
Yeah.

DONNA
neu
Josh?

JOSH
neu
Yeah?

DONNA
neu
You shouldn't feel uncomfortable about interviewing me.

JOSH
pos
I met you. I talked to you. I hired you. You know anybody around here who uses drugs?

DONNA
pos
Yeah.

JOSH
neu
You want to tell me who they are?

DONNA
pos
No.

JOSH
pos
Good for you. Consider yourself interviewed.

DONNA
pos
You're a good boy, Josh.

JOSH
pos
Donna, I've seen your records.

DONNA
pos
I know.

JOSH
pos
You need to learn that 'no parking' means no parking.

DONNA
pos
The thing is sometimes I can't find a space.

JOSH
pos
Go to work.

MANDY
neg
We have everyone take a drug test and be done with it.

JOSH
neg
What makes you think that everyone here can pass a drug test?

MANDY
neg
The ones who can't already know it and will quietly resign.

JOSH
neg
[laughs] Oh, okay. Problem solved.

MANDY
neg
What is wrong in this day and age with demonstrating that the White House is drug free? What is wrong with giving people that comfort?

JOSH
neg
I would think that in this day and age, people would be more comfortable knowing that they will not now, nor will they ever be forced to turn over evidence against themselves. And please, do not try and paint your position as anything other than preservation of a spotlight.

MANDY
neg
This thing gets bungled, and we're not gonna have to struggle much to find the spotlight.

JOSH
neu
[pause] So what do you think's really going on here?

MANDY
neg
I don't know.

JOSH
neu
I don't know either.

MANDY
neu
That's what makes me nervous.

JOSH
neu
What do we do?

MANDY
neu
It's time to talk to whoever it is you talk to.

JOSH
neu
Yeah.

REPORTER
neg
Is there any reason to believe that White House staffers regularly use illegal drugs?

C.J.
neg
For those who didn't understand me the first nine times, we are looking into this.

REPORTER
neu
C.J.?

STEVE
neu
C.J., would you forgive a blunt question?

C.J.
neg
These questions haven't been blunt yet?

STEVE
neu
Do you use drugs?

C.J.
neg
No, and you're forgiven.

CHRIS
neu
It's been 24 hours since Congressman Lillienfield made his accusations, C.J. When is the White House...?

C.J.
neg
We have 1300 people on the payroll, Chris. That's a lot of information to gather, and it's not like we were loaded with free time before. And let me just add that as no one and nothing here has been subpoenaed, and Mr. Lillienfield has offered nothing to support his very bizarre claim, we're not feeling the real need to get this done in a hurry.

CHRIS
neu
C.J., one more question...

C.J.
neg
Thank you. That's all. [walks away, to a staffer] Set fire to the room. Do it now.

DANNY
pos
How you doing?

C.J.
neg
What do you want?

DANNY
neu
It was a bit of a blunder back there.

C.J.
neg
It was fine.

DANNY
neu
You challenged Lillienfield to present evidence. He knows his cue when he hears it.

C.J.
neu
[looks around] I left my notebook somewhere.

DANNY
neg
Also, did you really want to be the first person to use the word 'subpoena'?

C.J.
neg
In the context?

DANNY
neu
What the context was. It's the only word anybody's gonna read tomorrow.

C.J.
neg
I really don't need your tips, Danny.

DANNY
neu
As a matter of fact, you do, C.J. but that's not why I'm here.

C.J.
neg
Why are you here?

DANNY
pos
I'm here because there's a basketball team called the New York Knickerbockers who are playing in town tonight.

C.J.
neu
I don't have time for a little basketball game!

DANNY
pos
Neither do I. Which is why we I thought could watch it in your office while I explain it to you in a patronizing manner, 'cause I know it's something women usually like.

C.J.
pos
Thank you, anyway.

DANNY
pos
You understand I'll talk slow and explain it the way any girl would appreciate.

JOSH
neu
Danny. You got a minute?

DANNY
neu
Walk me to my car.

DANNY
neu
Josh, the information I get I have to print.

JOSH
neu
Do you have any information?

DANNY
neu
No.

JOSH
neu
Would you tell me if you did?

DANNY
neu
What kind of information?

JOSH
neg
You know what kind of information.

DANNY
neg
Hey.

JOSH
neg
You know no one knows where I got it.

DANNY
neg
You know in the highroad, I'm not supposed to hand out any information I get.

JOSH
neu
You're right.

DANNY
neg
You know I'm right. It's not my job to help you out. As a matter of fact, I get fired from my job for helping you out.

JOSH
neu
I know that.

DANNY
neu
Lillienfield's a jackass, but he's not stupid. He's talking. He's got something.

JOSH
neu
What?

DANNY
neu
Whatever it is it's small potatoes. It's enough to get the rock rolling down the mountain.

JOSH
neu
What's he trying to hit?

DANNY
neu
I don't know.

JOSH
neu
Is it the nomination?

DANNY
neu
That's what I thought too, but Harrison's gonna sail by no matter what.

JOSH
neu
Nobody said it's Harrison.

DANNY
neu
Yeah. Yeah. My point is this: He's not gonna waste it on a done deal. He's after something better.

JOSH
neu
Okay. Thanks. [starts to walk the other way]

DANNY
neu
Josh, it's one of those times, man. Don't screw this up.

JOSH
pos
C.J. likes goldfish.

DANNY
pos
What?

JOSH
pos
She likes goldfish. Can't get enough of them.

DANNY
pos
Thanks!

BARTLET
neu
Here's an interesting statement. [reads] 'I join Judge Black, insomuch as while enjoying my privacy, I am compelled to admit that government has a right to invade it unless specifically prohibited by some specific Constitutional provision.' Unquote.

SAM
neu
Mr. President, this paper, is, in no uncertain terms, an argument of privacy is not a right guaranteed by the Constitution.

BARTLET
neg
Why isn't this ever been brought up?

TOBY
neu
It never came up, sir.

BARTLET
neg
We spent two months vetting our homerun nominee, he doesn't believe in a privacy guarantee, and it never came up?

TOBY
neu
It was simply never an issue in any order to be handed down, and if I may sir, we don't know for sure that he's the author of the document...

SAM
neg
We do know.

TOBY
neg
...If he is, I don't think we can necessarily hold a 55 year old man responsible...

SAM
neg
Toby?

TOBY
neg
...for something he wrote when he's 26.

SAM
neg
We're not gonna be able to hold him responsible if we put him on the bench. And I promise you, this issue's gonna come up!

BARTLET
neu
[pause, sighs] When does Harrison get in?

SAM
neu
Later tonight.

BARTLET
neu
I want him first thing in the morning.

SAM
neu
Yes sir.

BARTLET
neg
When was the last time either of you slept, I don't care. Get ready for this.

TOBY
neu
Yes sir.

SAM
neu
Thank you, Mr. President.

TOBY
neu
Thank you sir.

LEO
neu
Seventeen billion isn't gonna fly. They're gonna say it's too much at thirteen five.

BARTLET
neu
Excuse me.

LEO
neu
Give us the room. [The people leave at an instant.]

BARTLET
neu
I want to meet Mendoza.

LEO
neu
Yes sir.

TOBY
neu
Does Mendoza know why he's coming here?

MANDY
neu
He thinks he's interviewing for a place in the President's Commission for Hispanic Opportunity.

TOBY
neu
Is there such a thing as the president's...?

MANDY
neg
It's the best I could do in short notice, Toby.

TOBY
neu
Fine.

MANDY
neu
I had to make a letterhead.

TOBY
pos
That must have taxed your considerable creativity.

MANDY
neg
Toby?

TOBY
neu
Fine.

BARTLET
neu
Judge Harrison, first thing's first, are you the author of this unsigned note?

HARRISON
pos
[chuckles] Yes sir.

BARTLET
pos
When I was 26, I wrote a paper supporting the deregulation of Far East trade barriers. Nearly got thrown out of the London School of Economics. I was young and stupid, and trying to make some noise.

HARRISON
neu
Yes sir.

BARTLET
pos
I'm gonna bring Toby Ziegler and Sam Seaborn in here and talk about this a little bit.

HARRISON
pos
That's fine sir.

BARTLET
neu
Okay. Charlie, please?

JOSH
neu
Toby, you got a minute?

TOBY
neu
They're about to call me in.

JOSH
neu
Privacy?

TOBY
neu
I don't know.

JOSH
neg
He doesn't acknowledge the protection?

TOBY
neg
Hang on a second.

JOSH
neg
When were you gonna tell me this?

TOBY
neg
Number one: I don't report to you.

JOSH
neg
Toby...

TOBY
neg
Number two: He wrote the paper a quarter century ago.

JOSH
neg
He hasn't changed his mind.

TOBY
neg
We don't know whether he changed his mind or not.

JOSH
neg
We don't care whether he changed his mind or not. You're painting a picture for the president.

TOBY
neg
The president can paint his own picture.

JOSH
neu
Yeah, but he listens to you. [beat] When did we get the idea that Harrison was our guy? When we used to talk it was never Harrison.

CHARLIE
neu
[walks up] Toby?

TOBY
neu
Yeah?

CHARLIE
neu
They're ready for you.

MARGARET
neu
Leo?

LEO
neu
Yeah?

MARGARET
neu
Josh was wondering if you had a moment.

LEO
neu
Yeah.

JOSH
neu
Leo.

LEO
neu
Hey.

LEO
pos
I guess you're the guy with the worst job in the building this week, huh?

JOSH
pos
[laughs] I was interrogating this intern from the Legislative Liaison's Office, and she broke down crying while telling me about the bong she had made out of an eggplant.

LEO
pos
You can do that?

JOSH
pos
I used to use a potato.

LEO
pos
You've always been industrious.

JOSH
neu
[goes around and sits across Leo] Lillienfield's not after that kid in the Liaison's Office, and he's not even after the Senior Staff.

LEO
neu
Yeah.

JOSH
neu
Leo, you... know the worst kept secret in Washington... is that you're a recovering alcoholic, right?

LEO
neu
I had a hunch.

JOSH
neg
Leo, you're... Boston-Irish Catholic. Back there and back then, a drinking problem wasn't a problem. [beat] This isn't what he's after... Were you maybe into something that wasn't so acceptable?

LEO
neg
[pause] Pills.

JOSH
neg
Were you in treatment?

LEO
neg
Sierra-Tucson. Six years ago.

JOSH
neg
Leo...

LEO
neg
Records kept by these facilities are confidential, Josh.

JOSH
neg
[quietly] He's got 'em.

JOSH
pos
You're Leo McGarry. You're not gonna be taken down by this... small fraction of a man. [stands and opens the door] I won't permit it.

HARRISON
neg
Judges are bound to interpret the Constitution within the strict parameters of the text itself. The Constitution doesn't provide for a right of privacy. The right doesn't exist.

SAM
neg
The third amendment says soldiers can't be quartered in private homes. The fifth provides protection against self-incrimination, and the fourth against unreasonable searches. You deny the right to privacy lived in those passages?

HARRISON
neg
No. I do not deny it, but the fact that the framers enumerated those specific protections is all the more reason to believe that they had no intention of making privacy a de facto right.

SAM
neg
They just fought a revolution but they had no question of their freedom. The Bill of Rights wasn't meant to codify the most crucial of those rights not to limit the others.

HARRISON
neg
I do this for a living, Mr. Seaborn.

SAM
neg
So do I, your honor.

BARTLET
pos
Peyton, do I have the right to put on an ugly plaid jacket and a loud polka-dot tie and walk down Main Street?

HARRISON
neu
Yes.

BARTLET
pos
Where in the Constitution is that right guaranteed?

HARRISON
neu
First Amendment. Freedom of expression.

BARTLET
pos
What about the use of cream in my coffee? Surely, there can be no free speech argument to be made there?

HARRISON
neg
No.

BARTLET
pos
So you have no objection to the state of New Hampshire passing a law banning use of cream in coffee?

HARRISON
neg
I would have strong objection, Mr. President, as I like cream as well, but I would have no Constitutional basis to strike down the law when you brought this case to the Supreme Court.

BARTLET
pos
As I lose the votes of coffee drinkers everywhere.

DANNY
neu
Hey.

C.J.
neu
Hey.

DANNY
neu
What you doing?

C.J.
pos
You were right.

DANNY
neu
I know.

C.J.
pos
The word 'subpoena' appears in the lead in every story of this morning's papers.

DANNY
neu
I know.

C.J.
pos
Not yours.

DANNY
pos
That's just 'cause I couldn't spell it.

C.J.
neu
What are you holding?

DANNY
pos
It's a goldfish.

C.J.
pos
Why?

DANNY
pos
It's for you.

C.J.
neu
Really?

DANNY
pos
Josh said you liked goldfish.

C.J.
pos
[out of her laugh] The crackers, Danny. The cheese things that you have at a party?

DANNY
neg
Well... You know what, I'm not a hundred percent sure I'm supposed to know that.

C.J.
pos
The crackers, Danny.

DANNY
pos
Fine. Now I got a goldfish.

C.J.
pos
[laughs] Give it to me.

DANNY
pos
No.

C.J.
pos
No, you'll kill it.

DANNY
pos
You think I can't take care of a goldfish?

C.J.
pos
I absolutely do not. [takes the fishbowl from Danny]

DANNY
pos
The name's Gail, by the way.

C.J.
pos
The fish?

DANNY
pos
Yeah.

C.J.
pos
You named it Gail?

DANNY
pos
No, the guy in the store.

C.J.
pos
[laughs again] Oh... That's... Come here. [kisses Danny on the cheek] Thanks for the fish.

DANNY
neu
Keep your head in the game.

SAM
neg
In 1787, there was a sizable block of delegates who were initially opposed to the Bill of Rights. One member of the Georgia delegation had to stay by way of opposition: 'If we list the set of rights, some fools in the future are going to claim that people are entitled only to those rights enumerated and no longer. The framers knew...'

HARRISON
neg
Were you just calling me a fool, Mr. Seaborn?

SAM
neg
I wasn't calling you a fool, sir, the brand new state of Georgia was.

HARRISON
neg
Gentlemen, laws must emanate from the Constitution.

TOBY
neu
There are natural laws, judge.

HARRISON
neg
I do not deny there are natural laws, Mr. Ziegler. I only deny that judges are empowered to enforce them.

TOBY
neu
Then who will?

HARRISON
neg
That's not up to me. And this sideshow is over. With all due respect, Mr. President, I find this kind of questioning very rude.

SAM
neg
Well then, you're really gonna enjoy meeting the U.S. Senate.

HARRISON
neg
Be that as it may, it's disgusting. We all know you need me as much as I need you. I read the same polling information you do. Seven to ten point bump, 90 votes, unanimous out of committee, I was courted. Now, you have me taken to school by some kid.

BARTLET
pos
This Sam is young, drives me nuts too, but he took you off for a ride, sir, because that's what I told him to do.

HARRISON
neg
I am an extremely well credentialed man, Mr. President, and I'm unaccustomed to this sort of questioning.

BARTLET
pos
I understand, Peyton. Could you give us a little time, please? We'll make you comfortable while you're waiting.

HARRISON
neu
Certainly.

BARTLET
pos
Thank you.

SAM
neg
Put him on a bus.

TOBY
neg
With a guaranteed confirmation we're sending out the door based on a 30-year-old paper, which by the way, no one will know about but us.

BARTLET
neg
You don't think the guy who called Sam wouldn't know how to call a senator's office?

TOBY
neg
Mr. President, if this is really about abortion, we already talked about...

SAM
neu
It's not about abortion. It's about the next 20 years. Twenties and thirties, it was the role of government. Fifties and sixties, it was civil rights. The next two decades, it's gonna be privacy. I'm talking about the Internet. I'm talking about cellphones. I'm talking about health records, and who's gay and who's not. And moreover, in a country born on a will to be free, what could be more fundamental than this?

BARTLET
neu
Toby?

TOBY
neu
[beat] Let's meet Mendoza.

MANDY
neu
They're meeting with Mendoza.

JOSH
neu
Yeah.

MANDY
neg
Yeah, and I'm just gonna go kill myself now.

JOSH
neu
You think Mendoza would be a bad justice?

MANDY
neg
I think Mendoza would make a great justice. I think he makes a lousy nominee.

JOSH
neu
Why?

MANDY
neu
He's ruled in favor of same sex marriages...

JOSH
neu
He didn't rule in favor of it, Mandy. He's not recommending it. He's ruled that the state has no right to interfere with it.

MANDY
neu
He's got the broadest possible interpretation for free speech.

JOSH
neu
And listening to you sometimes, I honestly wish you'd narrow it, so...

MANDY
neg
You don't have to tell me how to be a good person, Josh. I'm the one who has to sell this. And he is not exactly America's idea of Supreme Court justice.

JOSH
neg
Mandy, I don't...

MANDY
neg
Let's do a side-by-side comparison. [reads from piece of paper] Harrison went to Walnut Park Country Day, Phillips Exeter, and Princeton undergrad, and Harvard Law. Mendoza attended P.S. 138 in Brooklyn, City University of New York, and the New York Police Department. Harrison clerked for Warren Berger. Mendoza...

JOSH
neg
[off of the top of his head] New York City Police Department '65 to '76, Assistant District Attorney Brooklyn '76 to '80, Assistant U.S. Attorney Eastern District, Federal District Judge, Eastern District -- Let me tell you something, Mendoza went to Law School the hard way. He got shot in the leg, and when they offered him a hundred percent dispensation, he took a desk job instead and went to law school at night. He's brilliant, decisive, compassionate, and experienced. And if you don't think that he's America's idea of a jurist, then you don't have enough faith in Americans.

MANDY
neg
It's not Americans I don't have faith in, Josh. It's the White House Senior Staff.

MANDY
neg
This is not gonna be an easy one, and if all hell breaks loose over Lillienfield, it could honestly cripple us for a year, maybe more.

JOSH
neg
[sighs] Well, I mean, just the law of large numbers says We got to win one one of these days, right?

MANDY
neu
Yeah.

JOSH
pos
So let's make it a good one.

MANDY
pos
I still hate you.

JOSH
pos
Whatever.

ED
neu
Who was that?

MARGARET
neu
Roberto Mendoza.

HARRISON
neg
It's not necessary for you to stay here.

CHARLIE
neu
The president asked me to stay with you in case you needed anything. I'd be glad to stay outside if you prefer.

HARRISON
neu
Yes, please.

CHARLIE
neu
Would you like anything?

HARRISON
neu
Coffee, please.

CHARLIE
neu
Yes sir. [about to head out]

HARRISON
pos
You look very familiar. Is it possible we've met?

CHARLIE
neu
I caddied for two summers at Sandy Hooks, sir.

HARRISON
pos
Ah. Yes, of course.

CHARLIE
neu
Charlie Young.

HARRISON
pos
Charlie, of course.

CHARLIE
pos
I'll get your coffee. [leaves and closes the door]

BARTLET
pos
I'm sure we're almost done. Sam, what else you got?

SAM
neu
Judge Mendoza, I have a note that your rulings have been upheld by the Court of Appeals more than any other district judge in the country.

MENDOZA
pos
Well, that's what comes by being right most of the time, I guess.

BARTLET
pos
You need me, Leo?

LEO
pos
For just a moment, sir.

BARTLET
pos
Would you excuse me?

MENDOZA
neu
Certainly.

LEO
neu
Mr. President...

BARTLET
neu
What is it, Leo?

LEO
neg
There's gonna be trouble.

BARTLET
neu
Lillienfield?

LEO
neg
Yes sir.

BARTLET
neg
He knows?

LEO
neg
We think so.

BARTLET
neg
We?

LEO
neg
Josh has it.

BARTLET
neg
What does Josh say?

LEO
pos
Get through it.

BARTLET
pos
Josh is a smart guy.

LEO
pos
No sir. Josh is a young guy.

BARTLET
pos
We used to be too.

LEO
neu
Mr. President...

BARTLET
neu
Did you have a drink yesterday?

LEO
neu
No sir.

BARTLET
neu
Are you gonna have one today?

LEO
neu
No sir.

BARTLET
pos
That's all you ever have to say to me.

LEO
neg
You know it's gonna make things very hard for a while.

BARTLET
pos
You fought in a war, got me elected, and you run the country. I think we all owe you one, don't you?

CHARLIE
neu
Mr. President...

BARTLET
neu
Did Harrison get off okay?

CHARLIE
neu
Yes sir. There's a crowd building outside your office.

BARTLET
neu
Why?

CHARLIE
neu
I think word's gotten out what's going on in here, sir.

BARTLET
pos
I'll bet it has. [turns to Sam] Do you have any more questions, Sam?

SAM
neu
No sir.

TOBY
neu
I have one, sir.

MENDOZA
pos
Let me say that this is not an easy commission to get appointed to.

TOBY
neu
Judge, without knowing details of special circumstance, what would you say of someone being fired from refusing to take a drug test at the order of the president?

MENDOZA
neu
Without details of special circumstances?

TOBY
neu
Yes sir.

MENDOZA
neu
Without showing cause, I would say that the order constitutes an illegal search, and I would order that the employee be reinstated.

BARTLET
neu
Toby?

TOBY
pos
Sold.

BARTLET
pos
Judge Mendoza, would it surprise you to learn that for the past few months, your name has been in the short list of candidates for the bench?

MENDOZA
neu
Yes, Mr. President.

BARTLET
pos
Well, then this is gonna knock your socks off. Tomorrow evening at 5 o'clock, I am naming you as my nominee to be the next associate justice of the United States Supreme Court. You were not the first choice, but you are the last one, and the right one. [beat] Will you accept the nomination?

MENDOZA
pos
[beat] With honor.

BARTLET
pos
Good.

BARTLET
pos
Thank you. Sam and Toby will be in charge of your confirmation.

SAM
pos
Congratulations, Judge.

MENDOZA
pos
Thank you. [shake hands]

TOBY
pos
It's gonna be an excruciating battle, Mr. Justice, one I have no intention of losing.

BARTLET
pos
What do you say, Leo? You up for a good fight?

LEO
pos
I believe I have one in me, yes sir.

BARTLET
pos
Good. Let the good fight begin.

BARTLET
pos
Mr. Justice Mendoza!
